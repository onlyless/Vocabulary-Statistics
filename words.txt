News Report One
Thirty-five people have been killed
and many more injured in a bomb attack
at the busiest airport in Moscow.
Russian investigators say the blast in the arrivals hall
at Domodedovo Airport
was caused by a suicide bomber.
Daniel Sandford is at the scene.
The explosion happened just before 4:30 local time.
Several international flights had just arrived.
Eyewitnesses said the baggage hall was packed.
There was a huge explosion,
and the whole building shook.
The site of what appears to have been a destructive bomb
was in the area
where relatives and drivers wait for people
to come through customs.
The pick-up and set-down area was soon crowded
with ambulances and fire engines.
The President immediately postponed his trip to Davos
and promised those responsible would be tracked down.
Question 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. What happened at the Domodedovo Airport?
2. What did the President do after the incident?
News Report Two
In developing countries,
childbirth is often a life and death struggle
for both mothers and children.
The U.S. charity, Save the Children,
says more than four million infants worldwide
die in their first month of life each year,
mostly due to infections.
A third of the deaths occur in Southeast Asia.
South Asia has the highest rates
of newborn deaths in the world, except Africa.
In Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example,
up to six percent of infants die in their first month.
Many women also do not survive complications
during pregnancy and childbirth.
Amy Weissman is a health expert
for Save the Children in Vietnam.
She says the mothers most at risk
are young, uneducated women who give birth at home,
without the help of skilled professionals.
Question 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.

The United Nations Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon has warned
that hundreds of thousands of Burmese lives could be at risk
unless the military government removes all restrictions
on foreign aid following Cyclone Nargis a week ago.
The UN has appealed for almost 200 million dollars in aid.
The Burmese ambassador to the UN
said his country would accept help from any quarter.
His government has said
that it is not ready to allow in
foreign search and rescue teams.
But the UN's Head of Humanitarian Affairs
John Holmes said
he believed Burma could become more flexible
after the constitutional vote.
 "The pressure on them from everyone, from us of course,
but also from many states around the world,
including their friends in ASEAN, in China and India,
they are all saying please be more open
because there is no time to lose to get the aid in
and I hope they will begin to listen." Holmes said.
Polling in the voting is now underway.
In his BBC interview,
Mr. Holmes described as naive suggestions
that the UN and the aid organizations
could impose help on Burma
without the agreement of the government.
He said air-dropping supplies
would be very much a last resort.
Question 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.

Section B
Directions: In this section,
you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation,
you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
W: Hi, Leo.
Why do you say English will become the world language?
M: Well, for one thing, it's so commonly used.
The only language that is used by more people is Chinese.
W: Why is English spoken by so many people?
M: It's spoken in many countries of the world
because of the British Empire.
And now, of course, there's the influence of America as well.
W: Many students find English a difficult language to learn.
M: Oh, all languages are difficult to learn.
But English does have two great advantages.
W: What are they?
M: Well, first of all,
it has a very international vocabulary.
It has many German, Dutch, French,
Spanish and Italian words in it.
So speakers of those languages
will find many familiar words in English.
In fact,
English has words from many other languages as well.
W: Why is that?
M: Well, partly because English speakers have travelled a lot.
They bring back words with them,
so English really does have an international vocabulary.
W: And what's the other advantage of English?
M: It's that English grammar is really quite easy.
For example, it doesn't have dozens of different endings
for its nouns, adjectives and verbs,
not like Latin, Russian, and German for example.
W: Why is that?
M: Well, it's quite interesting actually.
It's because of the French.
When the French ruled England,
French was the official language
and only the common people spoke English.
They try to make the language as simple as possible,
so they made the grammar easier.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation
you have just heard.
8. What does the man say about Chinese?
9. What made English a widely used language?
10. What is said to be special about English vocabulary?
11. What does the man say about Latin, Russian, and German?
Conversation Two
M: Hello. Yes?
W: Hello. Is that the sales department?
M: Yes, it is.
W: Oh, well, my name's Jane Kingsbury of GPF Limited.
Um, we need some supplies for our design office.
M: Oh? What sort?
W: Well, first of all,
we need one complete new drawing board.
M: A DO44 or DO45?
W: Uh, I don't know. What's the difference?
M: Well, the 45 costs 15 pounds more.
W: Hmm, so what's the total price then?
M: It's 387 pounds.
W: Does that include value-added tax?
M: Oh, I'm not sure.
Most of the prices do. Yes, I think it does.
W: Hmm. What are the boards actually made of?
M: Oh, I don't know.
I think it's a sort of plastic stuff these days.
It's white anyway.
W: Hmm. And how long does it take to deliver?
M: Oh, I couldn't really say.
It depends on how much work we've got
and how many other orders
there are to send out, you know.
W: Ok. Now we also want some drawing pens,
ink and rulers and some drawing paper.
M: Oh, dear.
The girl that takes orders for supplies isn't here this morning,
so I can't take those orders for you.
I only do the equipment, you see.
W: OK. Well, perhaps I'll ring back tomorrow.
M: So do you want the drawing board then?
W: I'll have to think about it. Thanks very much.
I'll let you know. Goodbye.
M: Thank you. Goodbye.
Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation

Passage One
No one knows for sure just how old kites are.
In fact, they have been in use for centuries.
Twenty-five centuries ago,
kites were well-known in China.
These first kites were probably made of wood.
They may even have been covered with silk,
because silk was used a lot at that time.
Early kites were built for certain uses.
In ancient China,
they were used to carry ropes across rivers.
Once across, the ropes were tied down
and wooden bridges were hung from them.
Legend tells of one general
who flew musical kites over the enemy's camp.
The enemy fled,
believing the sounds to be the warning voices of angels.
By the 15th century, many people flew kites in Europe.
Marco Polo may have brought the kite back
from his visit to China.
The kite has been linked to great names and events.
For instance,
Benjamin Franklin used the kite to prove
that lightening is electricity.
He flew the kite in a storm.
He did this in order to draw lightening from the clouds.
He tied a metal key and a strip of silk to the kite line.
The silk ribbon would stop the lightening
from passing through his body.
Benjamin's idea was first laughed at,
but later on it led to the invention of the lightening rod.
With such grand history,
kite flying is sure to remain an entertaining and popular sport.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about kites?
17. What did ancient Chinese use kites to do?
18. Why did Benjamin Franklin fly a kite in a storm?
Passage Two
I have learned many languages,
but I have not mastered them
the way a professional interpreter or translator has.
Still, they have opened doors for me.
They have allowed me the opportunity to seek jobs
in international contexts and help me get those jobs.
Like many people who have lived overseas for a while,
I simply got crazy about it.
I can't imagine living my professional or social life
without international interactions.
Since 1977,
I have spent much more time abroad
than in the United States.
I like going to new places,
eating new foods and experiencing new cultures.
If you can speak the language,
it's easier to get to know the country and its people.
If I had the time and money,
I would live for a year in as many countries as possible.
Beyond my career,
my facility with languages has given me
a few rare opportunities.
Once just after I returned from my year in Vienna,
I was asked to translate for a German judge
at an Olympic level horse event.
I learned a lot about the sport.
In Japan, once when I was in the studio audience
of a TV cooking show,
I was asked to go up on the stage
and taste the beef dish
that was being prepared and tell what I thought.
They asked, "Was it as good as American beef?"
It was very exciting for me to be on Japanese TV
speaking in Japanese about how delicious the beef was.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What does the speaker say about herself?
20. What does the speaker say about many people
who have lived overseas for a while?
21. How did the speaker's experience
of living in Vienna benefit her?
22. What was the speaker asked to do in a Japanese studio?
Passage Three
Dr. Ben Carson grew up
in a poor single-parent household in Detroit.
His mother, who had only a third-grade education,
worked two jobs cleaning bathrooms.
To his classmates and even to his teachers,
he was thought of as the dumbest kid in the class,
according to his own not so fond memories.
He had a terrible temper,
and once threatened to kill another child.
Dr. Carson was headed down a path of self-destruction
until a critical moment in his youth.
His mother, convinced that
she had to do something dramatic
to prevent him from leading a life of failure,
laid down some rules.
He could not watch television
except for two programs a week,
could not play with his friends after school
until he finished his homework,
and had to read two books a week
and write book reports about them.
His mother's strategy worked.
"Of course, I didn't know she couldn't read,
so there I was submitting these reports." He said.
"She would put check marks on them
like she had been reading them.
As I began to read about scientists,
economists and philosophers,
I started imaging myself in their shoes."
As he got in the habit of hard work,
his grades began to soar.
Ultimately, he received a scholarship
to attend Yale University.
And later, he was admitted
to the University of Michigan Medical School.
He is now a leading surgeon
at John's Hopkins Medical School,
and he is also the author of three books.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. What do we learn about Ben Carson?
24. What did Ben Carson's classmates and teachers
think of him when he was first at school?
25. What did Ben Carson's mother tell him to do
when he was a school boy?

Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
News Report One
The United States government has announced the plans
that it says will ensure that the all traffic on the Internet
is treated equally
regardless of how much behind with it to take up.
The head of Federal Communications Commission
Julius Genachowski said
it is vital to guarantee open and neutral Internet.
In the major speech to a Washington think tank
Julius Genachowski outlined the roadmap for all operators
including wireless to follow.
He is meant to ensure that the Internet service providers
cannot block or slow down Internet traffic
like the ban with excessive video downloads.
Mr. Genachowski's move to extend the rules to wireless
aims to make more people get online using a mobile phone.
Gigi Sohn of public knowledge
backs the inclusion of wireless operators
because she says wireless is the next frontier
and where the great growth of Internet accesses
is going to come from.
Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. What is the purpose of government's proposals
in the United States?
2. What can we learn about Genachowski's speech
from the news?

News Report Two
NATO troops in Afghanistan have rescued a reporter
of the New York Times newspaper
who had been held by the Taliban
in the northern province of Kunduz since Saturday.
The New York Times said the journalist Stephen Farrell
was unharmed after being released in the gun battle.
A military operation led by NATO forces
rescued Stephen Farrell from a village
in the northern province of Kunduz
where he had been kidnapped last week
while reporting on the consequence of a NATO airstrike.
In remarks quoted on the New York Times website
he says he heard British and Afghan voices
as bullets started flying around.
That suggests that British troops
were involved in the rescue
although there has been no confirmation of that.
Stephen Farrell's colleague Sultan Munadi,
an Afghan interpreter
who's worked for the New York Times for several years
was killed in the exchange of fire.
Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
3. What do we learn about the journalist Stephen Farrell
from the news?
4. When did the Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi
lose his life?

News Report Three
At the heart of the dispute
is whether food aid to developing countries
should be in the form of cash or agricultural products,
often subsidized by donors.
The European Union argues
that cash donations are the best way
to quickly purchase food in an emergency
because food shipments are sometimes sold
in local markets at the receiving end.
And European countries say
flooding markets with cheap imported food
drives local farmers out of business.
Edward Clay, Senior Research Associate
at the Overseas Development Institute in London
says the European approach makes food aid more flexible.
The United States argues
that the European cash-only approach has been ineffective,
causing a steep decline in food aid since the 1990s.
According to a report published by the World Food Program,
food aid contributions suffered
a 1 billion dollar shortfall last year.
In contrast, the U.S. sends donations to developing countries
in the form of corn, wheat and other commodities.
Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. What is the dispute between the European Union
and the United States?
6. Why is The European Union in favor of cash donations?
7. How does the United States think of the European approach?

M: Good. And could I have your phone number?
W: Yes, 7788992.
M: Fine. And your date of birth, please?

But I'm not enjoying it very much, and it doesn't pay very well.
M: I see. Have you applied for any other jobs?
W: Yes. I thought I'd like to be a policewoman
but they turned me down,
because I was too short.

I've been involved with pubs off and on for ten years.
I've sort of done hotel work and I've also run a restaurant pub.
And now I've got what you'd call a good old-fashioned pub.
That is, a public bar, with all the social games going with it,
which is what we've always wanted to have, you know.
W: It sounds like you've always worked in pubs,
but not always in this one.
M: No, no. I've worked in quite a variety of pubs.
W: What makes a good pub?
I mean you said, you know, it has got a good variety of things.
M: Well, I think having the right customers to start with,
selling the right beer, keeping it good,
and most of all keeping a good attitude yourself,
even though you probably feel very tired.
But the idea is, if you generate it from your side,
it's got to affect the other side
if you getting the right customers in.
W: Yeah. I must say that is one thing
that's always struck me about being a pub owner.
I mean a lot of people seem to think that it's a nice job, you know.

Passage One
To help ourselves and others,
it's important to know something about drugs.
A drug is a chemical substance.
It can bring about a physical, emotional, or mental change in people.
Alcohol and tobacco are drugs.
Caffeine, a substance found in coffee and some soft drinks,
is also a drug.
Drug abuse is the use of a drug, legal or illegal,
that hurts a person or someone close to him.
A drug user is the person who takes the drug.
There are many kinds of drug users.
Experimental users may try drugs once or twice.
They want to see what the effects will be.
Recreational users take drugs to get high.
They use drugs with friends or at parties to get into the mood or things.
Regular users take drugs all the time.
But they are often able to keep up with the normal routine of work.
Dependent users can't relate to anything but drugs.
Their whole life centers around drugs.
They feel extreme mental or physical pain without drugs.
It's not always easy to tell if someone is using drugs.
In the early stages, drug use is often hard to see.
Sometimes people like drugs or need drugs
so much they can't do without them.
They are dependent upon drugs.
Only a few kinds of drugs can cause physical dependence.
But almost any drug, when it's misused,
can make a person think he needs it all the time.
By this time it's too late, and the person is hooked.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about drug abuse?
17. What does the speaker say about recreational drug users?
18. What does the speaker say about drug dependence?
Passage Two
According to Charles Harper, chairman of Conagra,
the healthy choice line of frozen dinners began with his own heart attack.
It has been brought on by years of eating anything
he could get his hands on.
As he lay in the hospital recovering,
Harper imagined the line of healthy frozen foods that tasted good.
The healthy choice product line was carefully tested with consumers
before being introduced to the general public.
Conagra's Research and Development staff
spent a year working under the instruction:
whatever the cost, don't sacrifice taste.
The first test market results surprised even the Conagra team.
The low-sodium, low-fat frozen dinners sold much better than expected.
According to the firm's vice-president of Marketing and Sales,
"We benefited from low expectations.
The products were much better than people thought they would be."
This finding supported Conagra's decision
to position the product against other high quality frozen dinners,
rather than as a diet or health food.
The new product's brand name and packaging
were an important part of the development process.
The name "healthy choice" was chosen
for the positive implication it held for consumers.
Because Conagra felt the product would be an impulse purchase,
it was important to make the item stand out in the freezer case.
This was accomplished through the dark green packaging
that not only differed from the competitors,
but also suggested freshness and richness in vitamins.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What did Charles Harper think of while he was in hospital?
20. What does the passage say about the health choice product line
before it went to market?
21. What is said to contribute to Conagra's business success?
22. What does the speaker say about the name "healthy choice"?
Passage Three
In the United States,
36 states currently allow capital punishment
for serious crimes such as murder.
Americans have always argued about the death penalty.
Today, there is a serious question about this issue:
Should there be a minimum age limit for executing criminals?
In other words, is it right for convicted murders
who kill when they are minors---that is under the age of 18---
to receive the death penalty?
In most other countries of the world,
there is no capital punishment for minors.
In the United States, though, each state makes its own decision.
Of the 36 states that allow the death penalty,
30 permit the execution of minors.
In the state of South Carolina,
a convicted murderer was given the death penalty
for a crime he committed while he was a minor.
In 1977, when he was 17 years old,
James Terry Roach and two friends cruelly murdered three people.
Roach's lawyer fought the decision to execute him.
The young murderer remained on Death Row for ten years
while his lawyer appealed to the governor.
The lawyer argued that it is wrong to execute a person
for a crime he committed while he was a minor.
In the United States,
the governor of a state has the power
to change a sentence from the death penalty to life in prison.
Nonetheless, the governor of South Carolina
refused to stop the execution.
Roach was finally executed in 1986.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. What does the speaker say
about the death penalty in the United States?
24. What is the focus of the debate around the death penalty?
25. What does the speaker say about James Terry Roach?

News Report One
Hong Kong has introduced a minimum wage
that is expected to benefit 270,000 low-paid workers,
or around 10% of the working population.
Workers will now earn a minimum of HK28 dollars per hour.
The legislation was passed in response to public pressure
to narrow the territory's wealth gap.
But the minimum wage has been resisted
by the business community, who say it is too costly.
Business leaders say small businesses
will be forced to lay off staff.
Critics also say the legislation
is a departure from Hong Kong's free-market roots.
With the exception of Singapore,
most Asian countries now have a minimum wage
or are considering one.
The move is expected to boost
the pay of Hong Kong's street sweepers,
security guards and restaurant workers.
The legislation does not cover
the territory's almost 300,000 domestic helpers,
who mainly come from the Philippines and Indonesia.

praised the work of the security forces
in the southern Calabrian town of Rosarno,
where African farm workers rioted in the streets last week.
The two days of violence broke out
after a group of white local youths
supposedly shot two immigrants with a gun.
Maroni said the immediate reaction
on the part of security officials
from the start of the disorder
ensured the violence did not turn into
more serious incidents.
In all, 21 migrants were injured in the clashes,
with eight still hospitalized.
The interior minister said about 750 illegal immigrants
were transferred to holding centers
in the southern cities of Crotone and Bari.
He added that more than 300 with regular permits
left Rosarno voluntarily with their own means
to other destinations.
Maroni made clear the fight against illegal immigration

W: Bob, do you know who I saw the other day?
Old Jake, looking terribly depressed.
Did he get pensioned off at last?
M: Yes. They made him retire after 50 years at sea.
He is pretty upset about it.
But what can you do?
He really is past it.
W: He is all alone, isn't he?
M: Yes, his wife's been dead for years.
They had one daughter, Doris.
But she went off to town as soon as she left school.
And he hasn't heard from her since.
I hear she is making good money as a model.
W: Maybe someone could get in touch with her.
Get her to come back for a while to help?
M: I don't suppose she come.
She never got on with her father.
He is bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish.
Oh, I expect old Jake will get by.
He is healthy at least---
comes into a clinic for a check regularly.
W: Are you his doctor?
M: No, my partner doctor Johnson is.
W: That bad-tempered old thing?
M: Oh, he isn't really bad-tempered.
He just looks it.
He is an excellent doctor, taught me a lot,
and he has a very nice family.
His wife invites me over there to supper every week.
Very pleasant.
W: Yes.
I teach their daughter Pam at school.
She is a bit careless and lazy about her school work,
but a bright little thing and very popular with her age group.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation
you have just heard.
8. Why does old Jake look terribly depressed?
9. What do we learn about Jake's wife?
10. What does the man say about Jake's daughter?
11. What does the man say about Jake's doctor?
Conversation Two
W: Hello, Mr. Summerfield. How are you today?
M: Very well. Thank you, Ms. Green.
W: What can I do for you?
M: Well, unfortunately,
there is a problem with the order
we received from you yesterday.
It seems we have not received the right quantity of manuals
to support the telephone system.
W: Oh, dear, that's bad news.
I'm very sorry to hear that,
and you don't know how many packs are without manuals?
M: No, because we haven't opened every pack.
But in several of those that have been opened
there are none, no manuals.
W: I'm very sorry about this inconvenience, Mr. Summerfield.
We'll send out the manuals this afternoon
by express mail entirely at our cost,
and the manuals should arrive tomorrow
or the day after at the latest.
M: All of them, right?
W: Yes. It may be that some have them already,
but we cannot be sure.
So the best thing is to send out the manual for every pack.
M: Yes. Yes, I see. That would be great.
W: Please accept our apologies for this mix-up.
I assure you we will do everything possible
to find out why the mistake happened.
M: Right. Thanks for your swift action.
W: Not at all. Thank you and goodbye for now.
Do call if there is anything else.
M: All right. Thank you. Goodbye, Ms. Green.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Attracting and feeding wild birds are entertaining activities
that have long been enjoyed by people all over the world.
Feeding birds has become so popular
that prepared feed mixtures are readily available.
We feed birds for many reasons.
Many pleasant hours can come from watching birds.
A hobby often develops into a serious study of their habits.
Accurate identification of birds is usually the first goal.
But observations that an amateur bird-watcher
can make are really limitless.
There is, however,
responsibility associated with bird feeding,
including a disease hazard.
Attracting numbers of birds continually to the same spot
can be harmful to them,
particularly species that pick food from the ground
contaminated by the droppings of other birds.
In winter, feeding efforts are most satisfying to people
and are of greatest benefit to birds.
During this time when fewer natural foods are available
and air temperatures are lower,
extra feeding can keep a bird warm and well.
Once begun, feeding should never stop
during these lean months.
If you start a local increase of birds,
be prepared to do what may be required
to eliminate hazards to those you want to befriend.
A constant supply of food should be given
until the cold is over and spring has come.
If feeding is stopped during severe weather,
birds used to relying upon the feeders might starve.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage
you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about bird watching?
17. What does the speaker say
about birds fed continually on the same spot?
18. What does the speaker suggest we do
in feeding birds in winter?
Passage Two
My friend Leo makes up weak and poor excuses
whenever there is something he doesn't want to do.
Just two weeks ago,
he was at my house when he decided
he didn't want to go into work.
He called his boss and said
he had to get a new set of tires put on his truck.
Then he sat down and watched TV with me.
Not only had he lied
but his excuse wasn't a very convincing one.
Another time, he cancelled a date with his girlfriend
at the last minute,
telling her he had to get a new battery for his truck.
She was angry and refused to go out with him again
until he apologized.
Last weekend, Leo offered the poorest excuse yet.
He'd promised he'd help me move some furniture,
from my parents'house to my new apartment.
He was supposed to bring his truck over
about 8 o'clock Saturday morning.
I waited, and then called and left a message on his machine.
About 11:30, he called and said he was sorry
but he'd been getting a new set of tires put on his truck.
I guess he'd forgotten he used the same excuse
when he called his boss from my house.
I think I need a new set of friends.
I'm beginning to get tired of Leo's excuses.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What does the speaker tell us about her friend Leo?
20. What did his girlfriend do
when Leo canceled a date with her at the last minute?
21. What favor did the speaker ask Leo to do last weekend?
Passage Three
In Hollywood,
everybody wants to be rich, famous and beautiful.
Nobody wants to be old, unknown and poor.
For Hollywood kids, life can be difficult,
because they grow up in such an unreal atmosphere.
Their parents are ambitious
and the children are part of the parents'ambitions.
Parents pay for wasteful grand parties, expensive cars,
and designer clothes.
When every dream can come true,
kids don't learn the value of anything
because they have everything.
A 13-year-old boy, Trent Maguire,
has a driver, credit cards,
and unlimited cash to do
what he wants when he wants to.
"One day, I'll earn more than my Dad,"he boasts.
Parents buy care and attention for their children
because they have no time to give it themselves.
Amanda's mother employs a personal trainer,
a bodyguard, a singing coach and a counselor
to look after all her 15-year-old daughter's needs.
Often there is no parent at home most days,
so children decide whether to make their own meals
or go out to restaurants,
when to watch television or do homework.
They organize their own social lives.
They play no childhood games.
They become adults before they're ready.
Hollywood has always been the city of dreams.
The kids there live unreal lives
where money, beauty and pleasure are the only gods.
Will children around the world soon start to think the same?
Or do they already?
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage
you have just heard.
22. Why is life said to be difficult for Hollywood kids?
23. What does the speaker say about Trent Maguire,
a 13-year-old boy?
24. Why does Amanda's mother employ other people
to look after her needs?
25. What will probably have negative effects
on the lives of Hollywood kids?

News Report One
There are about 650,000 school-aged Syrian refugee children in Turkey.
Government officials estimate
only about one-third of them are going to school.
Educating the refugee children is an enormous task.
One U.S. official says
that a huge school system like the one in New York City
would be overwhelmed.
The United States says
it is working with the United Nations
to help bridge the education gap for refugee children.
Without school,
the effects will be negative and long-lasting.
The United States provided Turkey with aid for education earlier.
In December,
it offered an additional 24 million dollars.
Human Rights Watch says
a quality education will ensure a more stable future for these children.
The organization says
about 90 percent of children in refugee camps
run by the Turkish government attend school.
But most of the children living outside of those camps
are not receiving education.
Question 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. What is the news report mainly about?
2. What did the United States do to help refugee children?
News Report Two
Eleven Taliban fighters attacked an important airport
in southern Afghanistan early Tuesday,
killing at least 50 people,
Afghan officials said.
The Afghan Defense Ministry said 38 civilians,
10 soldiers and two police officers were killed.
The attack on the Kandahar Air Field lasted 20 hours,
reported The Washington Post.
Among the dead were women and children,
the newspaper wrote.
The airport includes a military base
with troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.
There were no reports
that NATO troops were killed or injured in the attack.
A spokesman for the Taliban says
fighters entered the base and attacked local and foreign military troops.
He said more than 150 soldiers were killed in the attack.
The Taliban often makes claims about the results of their attacks
that are not true.
Taliban attacks have grown in number and strength
in Afghanistan this year
after the withdrawal last year of combat troops from other countries.

4. What led to the growth of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan?
News Report Three
The Australian state of Tasmania is considering raising the legal age
for buying cigarettes to at least 21 and potentially as high as 25.
If the plan goes ahead
it will give Tasmania some of the toughest tobacco laws
in the world.
The current legal age to purchase,
possess or smoke cigarettes in all Australian states is 18.
Critics have complained
the proposed restrictions would be a violation of civil liberties.
Australia already has some of the world's toughest anti-smoking policies.
It introduced so-called plain packaging four years ago,
where packs are coloured an identical olive brown
and are covered in health warnings that include pictures.
The country is also one of the most expensive places
in the world to buy cigarettes
---from around 15 dollars a pack.
Parts of the world already ban cigarette sales to those under 21,
including Kuwait and, from next year, Hawaii.
Around one-in-five Tasmanians smoke,
with the vast majority taking up the habit before the age of 25.
The Tasmanian government proposals are part of a five-year plan
to make the state Australia's healthiest by 2025.
Question 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. What does the state of Tasmania plan to do?
6. According to plain packaging,
what should be included in the packs of cigarette?

M: Good morning, Walter Barry here, calling from London.
Could I speak to Mr. Grand, please?
W: Who's calling, please?
M: Walter Barry, from London.
W: What is it about, please?
M: Well, I understand
that your company has a chemical processing plant.
My own company LCP, Liquid Control Products,
is a leader in safety from leaks in the field of chemical processing.
I would like to speak to Mr. Grand to discuss ways
in which we could help TGC protect itself from such problems
and save money at the same time.
W: Yes, I see. Well, Mr. Grand is not available just now.
M: Can you tell me when I could reach him?
W: He's very busy for the next few days.
Then he'll be away in New York.
So it's difficult to give you a time.
M: Could I speak to someone else, perhaps?
W: Who, in particular?
M: A colleague, for example?
W: You're speaking to his personal assistant.
I can deal with calls for Mr. Grand.
M: Yes, well, could I ring him tomorrow?
W: No, I'm sorry. He won't be free tomorrow.
Listen, let me suggest something.
You send us details of your products and services,
together with references from other companies.
And then we will contact you.
M: Yes, that's very kind of you. I have your address.

M: Miss Yamada, did you ever think
that you would find yourself living and working
in the western world?
W: No, not really, although I've always listened to
recordings of great orchestras from Europe.
M: So you enjoyed classical music even when you were very young?
W: Oh, yes. I was an only child.

M: As young as that. Did you like it?
W: Oh, yes, very much.
M: When did you first play on your own?
I mean, when did you give your first performance?
W: I think I was eight...? No, nine.
I just had my birthday a week before.
And my father had bought me a new violin.
I played a small piece at the school concert.
M: Did you know then that you would become a professional violinist?
W: Yes, I think so. I enjoy playing the violin very much,
and I didn't mind practicing, sometimes three or four hours a day.
M: And when did you first come to Europe?
W: I was very lucky.
When I was fifteen, I won a scholarship to a college in Paris.
That was for a three-year course.
M: How did your parents feel about that?
W: I think they were pleased and worried at the same time.
It was the chance of a lifetime.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.

will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
What makes a person famous?
This is a mystery that many people have carefully thought about.
All kinds of myths surround the lives of well-known people.
Most people are familiar with the works of William Shakespeare,
one of the greatest Eng1ish writers
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Yet how many know Shakespeare, the person,
the man behind the works?
After centuries of research,
scholars are still trying to discover Shakespeare's personal history.
It is not easily found in his writings.
Authors of the time could not protect their works.
An acting company, for example,
could change a play if they wanted to.
Nowadays writers have copyrights that protect their work.
Many myths arose about Shakespeare.
Some said he had no formal education.
Others believe that he began his career
by tending the horses of wealthy men.
All of these myths are interesting, but are they true?
Probably not.
Shakespeare's father was a respected man in Stratford-on-Avon,
a member of the town council.
He sent young William to grammar school.
Most people of Elizabethan times
did not continue beyond grammar school;
so Shakespeare did have at least an average education.
Some parts of Shakespeare's life will always remain unknown.
The Great London Fire of 1666 burned many important documents
that could have been a source of clues.
We will always be left with many questions and few facts.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about William Shakespeare?
17. What do we learn about Shakespeare's father?
18. Why does the speaker say parts of Shakespeare's life
will remain a mystery?
Passage Two
Wherever you go and for whatever reason,
it's important to be safe.
While the majority of people you meet when travelling
are sure to be friendly and welcoming, there are dangers
---theft being the most common.
Just as in your home country,
do not expect everyone you meet to be friendly and helpful.
It's important to prepare for your trip in advance
and to take precautions while you are travelling.
As you prepare for your trip,
make sure you have the right paperwork.
You don't want to get to your destination,
only to find you have the wrong visa,
or worse, that your passport isn't valid anymore.
Also, make sure you travel with proper medical insurance,
so that if you're sick or injured during your travels,
you'll be able to get treatment.
If you want to drive while you are abroad,
make sure you have an international driver's license.
When you get to your destination, use official transport.
Always go to bus and taxi stands.
Don't accept rides from strangers who offer you a lift.
If there's no meter in the taxi, agree on a price before you get in.
If you prefer to stay in cheap hotels while travelling,
make sure you can lock the door of your room from the inside.
Finally, remember to smile.
It's the friendliest and most sincere form of communication.
And it is sure to be understood in any part of the world.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What is mentioned as a most common danger
when people go travelling abroad?
20. What is the most important thing to do
when you prepare for your trip abroad?
21. What does the speaker suggest you do
when you arrive at your destination?
Passage Three
The British are supposed to be famous for laughing at themselves,
but even their sense of humour has a limit,
as the British retailer Gerald Ratner found out to his cost.
When Ratner took over his father's chain of 130 jewelry shops in 1984,
he introduced a very clear company policy.
He decided that his shops should sell down market products
at the lowest possible prices.
It was a great success.
The British public loved his cheap gold earrings
and his tasteless silver ornaments.
By 1991, Ratner's company had 2,400 shops
and it was worth over 680 million pounds.
But in April of that year, Gerald Ratner made a big mistake.
At a big meeting of top British business people,
he suited up and explained the secret of his success.
People say "How can we sell our goods for such a low price?"
I say "Because they are absolute rubbish."
His audience roared with laughter.
But the British newspapers and the British public were not so amused.
People felt insulted and stayed away from Ratner's shops.
Sales fell and 6 months after his speech,
Ratner's share price had fallen by 42%.
The following year, things got worse
and Gerald Ratner was forced to resign.
By the end of 1992, he lost his company, his career and his house.
Even worse, 25,000 of his employees had lost their jobs.
It had been a very expensive joke.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What did Gerald Ratner decide to do
when he took over his father's shops?
23. On what occasion did Gerald Ratner explain
the secret of his success?
24. How did people feel
when they learned of Gerald Ratner's remarks?
25. What does the story of Gerald Ratner suggest?
This is the end of listening comprehension.

News Report One
A 16th century castle in Scotland is close to collapsing
after lumps of soil were washed away by floods,
threatening its foundations.
On Sunday, the castle's owner John Gordon, 76,
was forced to move out of his property
after the River Dee swept away about 60 feet of land,
leaving the castle dangerously close to the river,
according to the Scottish Daily Record.
Abergeldie castle,
located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,
was built by Sir Alexander Gordon of Midmar
who later became the Earl of Huntly.
The castle, which is located on 11,700 acres,
was leased to members of the royal family
between 1848 and 1970,
including King Edward VII and George V.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency
has issued more than 35 flood warnings covering several regions,
as Scotland continues to clean up
after Storm Frank hit the country last Wednesday.
"This means that rivers will rise more slowly,
but then stay high for much longer," the environmental agency said.
Question 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. Why did John Gordon move out of Abergeldie castle?
2. What happened in Scotland last Wednesday?
News Report Two
Rescue efforts were underway Thursday morning for 17 miners
who were stuck in an elevator below ground
at Cargill rock salt mine near Lansing, New York,
according to Marcia Lynch, public information officer
with Tompkins County's emergency response department.
Emergency workers have made contact with the miners
via a radio,
and they all appear to be uninjured,
said Jessica Verfuss,
the emergency department's assistant director.
Crews have managed to provide heat packs and blankets
to the miners so that they can keep warm
during the rescue operation, Verfuss said.
Details about what led to the workers' being trapped in the elevator
weren't immediately available.
The mine, along New York's Cayuga Lake,
processes salt used for road treatment.
It produces about 2 million tons of salt
that is shipped to more than 1,500 places
in the northeastern United States.
The rock salt mine is one of three operated by Cargill
with the other two in Louisiana and Ohio.
Question 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
3. What does the news report say about the salt miners?
4. What did the rescue team do?
News Report Three
The U.S. Postal Service announced today
that it is considering closing about 3,700 post offices
over the next year because of falling revenues.
Facing an $8.3 billion budget deficit this year,
closing post offices is one of several proposals
the Postal Service has put forth recently to cut costs.
Last week, for example,
Postmaster General Pat Donahoe announced plans
to stop mail delivery on Saturdays,
a move he says could save $3 billion annually.
"We are losing revenue as we speak," Donahoe said.
"We do not want taxpayer money.
We want to be self-sufficient.
So like any other business you have to make choices."
Dean Granholm,
the vice president for delivery and post office operations,
said the first wave of closings would begin this fall.
He estimated that about 3,000 postmasters, 500 station managers
and between 500 and 1,000 postal clerks could lose their jobs.
Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. What is the U.S. Postal Service planning to do?
6. What measure has been planned to save costs?
7. What will happen
when the proposed measure comes into effect?

you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
M: Mrs. Hampton,
we've got trouble in the press room this morning.
W: Oh dear. What about?
M: One of the press operators arrived an hour and a half late.
W: But that's a straightforward affair.
He will simply lose part of his pay.
That's why we have a clock-in system.
M: But the point is the man was clocked-in at 8 o'clock.
We have John standing by the time clock,
and he swears he saw nothing irregular.
W: Is John reliable?
M: Yes, he is.
That's why we chose him for the job.
W: Have you spoken to the man who was late?
M: Not yet.
I thought I'd have a word with you first.
He's a difficult man,
and I think there's been some trouble on the shop floor.
I've got a feeling that trade union representative is behind this.
The manager told me
that Jack Green's been very active around the shop
the last few days.
W: Well, what do you want me to do?
M: I was wondering if you'd see Smith,
the man who was late,
because you are so much better at handling things like this.
W: Oh, all right. I'll see him.
I must say I agree with you
about there being bad feelings in the works.
I've had the idea for some time
that Jack Green's been busy stirring things up
in connection with the latest wage claim.
He's always trying to make trouble.
Well, I'll get the manager to send Smith up here.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
8. What will happen to the press operator
who was late for work according to the woman?
9. What does the man say about John
who stands by the time clock?
10. Why does the man suggest the woman see the worker
who was late?
11. What does the woman say about Jack Green?
Conversation Two
W: Our topic today is about something
that foreigners nearly always say when they visit Britain.
It's "Why are the British so cold?"
And they're talking about the British personality
--- the famous British "reserve".
It means that we aren't very friendly,
we aren't very open.
M: So do you think it's true?
W: It's a difficult one.
So many people who visit Britain say
it's difficult to make friends with British people.
They say we're cold, reserved, unfriendly...
M: I think it's true.
Look at Americans or Australians.
They speak the same language,
but they're much more open.
And you see it when you travel,
people --- I mean strangers ---
speak to you on the street or on the train.
British people seldom speak on the train.
Or the bus.
Not in London, anyway.
W: "Not in London." That's it.
Capital cities are full of tourists and are never friendly.
People are different in other parts of the country.
M: Not completely.
I met a woman once, an Italian.
She's been working in Manchester for two years,
and no one --- not one of her colleagues ---
had ever invited her to their home.
They were friendly to her at work,
but nothing else.
She couldn't believe it.
She said that would never happen in Italy.
W: You know what they say
--- "an Englishman's home is his castle".
It's really difficult to get inside.
M: Yeah. It's about being private.
You go home to your house and your garden
and you close the door.
It's your place.
W: That's why the British don't like flats.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
In college, time is scarce,
and consequently, very precious.
At the same time,
expenses in college pile up surprisingly quickly.
A part-time job is a good way to balance costs
while ensuring there is enough time left over
for both academic subjects and after-class activities.
If you are a college student looking for a part-time job,
the best place to start your job search is right on campus.
There are tons of on-campus job opportunities,
and as a student,
you'll automatically be given hiring priority.
Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time,
and could be a great way to connect with academic
and professional resources at your university.
Check with your school's careers service
or employment office for help to find a campus job.
Of course,
there are opportunities for part-time work off-campus, too.
If you spend a little time digging for the right part-time jobs,
you'll save yourself time
when you find a job that leaves you with enough time
to get your school work done, too.
If you are a college student looking for work
but worry you won't have enough time
to devote to academic subjects,
consider working as a study hall or library monitor.
Responsibilities generally include supervising study spaces
to ensure that a quiet atmosphere is maintained.
It's a pretty easy job,
but one with lots of downtime
--- which means you'll have plenty of time to catch up on reading,
do homework or study for an exam.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about college students
applying for on-campus jobs?
17. What can students do to find a campus job
according to the speaker?
18. What does the speaker say
is a library monitor's responsibility?
Passage Two
Agricultural workers in green tea fields
near Mt. Kenya are gathering the tea leaves.
It is beautiful to see.
The rows of tea bushes are straight.
All appears to be well.
But the farmers who planted the bushes are worried.
Nelson Kibara is one of them.
He has been growing tea in the Kerugoya area for 40 years.
He says the prices this year have been so low
that he has made almost no profit.
He says he must grow different kinds of tea
if he is to survive.
Mr. Kibara and hundreds of other farmers
have been removing some of their tea bushes
and planting a new kind of tea
developed by the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya.
Its leaves are purple and brown.
When the tea is boiled,
the drink has a purple color.
Medical researchers have studied the health benefits of the new tea.
They say it is healthier than green tea
and could be sold for a price
that is three to four times higher than the price of green tea.
But Mr. Kibara says he has not received a higher price
for his purple tea crop.
He says the market for the tea is unstable
and he is often forced to sell his purple tea
for the same price as green tea leaves.
He says there are not enough buyers
willing to pay more for the purple tea.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. Why have tea farmers in Kenya decided to grow purple tea?
20. What do researchers say about purple tea?
21. What has Mr. Kibara found about purple tea?
Passage Three
Today's consumers want beautiful handcrafted objects to wear
and to have for their home environment.
They prefer something unique and they demand quality.
Craftsmen today are meeting this demand.
People and homes are showing great change
as more and more unique handcrafted items become available.
Handicrafts are big business.
No longer does a good craftsman have to work in a job
he dislikes all day and then try to create at night.
He has earned his professional status.
He is now a respected member of society.
Parts of the fun of being a craftsman is meeting other craftsmen.
They love to share their ideas and materials
and help others find markets for their work.
Craftsmen have helped educate consumers to make wise choices.
They help them become aware of design and technique.
They help them relate their choice to its intended use.
They often involve consumers in trying the craft themselves.
When a group of craftsmen expands to include more members,
a small craft organization is formed.
Such an organization does a lot in training workshops
in special media,
craft marketing techniques, craft fairs and sales, festivals,
TV appearances and demonstrations.
State art councils help sponsor local arts and crafts festivals
which draw crowds of tourist consumers.
This boosts the local economy considerably
because tourists not only buy crafts,
but they also use the restaurants and hotels
and other services of the area.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What does the speaker say about today's consumers?
23. What does the speaker say about good craftsmen in the past?
24. What do craftsmen help consumers do?
25. Why do state art councils help sponsor local arts
and crafts festivals?

New York State plans
to shut off the thundering waters
of Niagara Falls—again.
At least,
the American side of the falls.
This "once in a lifetime" event
actually may take place twice
in some folks' lives.
The New York State parks system
wants to turn off the falls
on the American side
sometime in the next two to three years
to replace two 115-year-old stone bridges
that allow pedestrians, park vehicles
and utilities access to Goat Island.
The American side of the falls
were shut off in 1969
to study the buildup of rock
at the base of the falls.
When that happened,
people came from all over the world
to see the falls turned off.
People are curious by nature.

after gunmen attacked a town
near the border with Libya.
The Interior and Defense ministries
said that the Tunisian government
has closed its two border crossings
with Libya
because of the attack.
The Tunisian military
has sent reinforcements
and helicopters to the area,
and authorities
have been hunting several attackers
who were still at large.
The violence came
amid increasing international concern
about Islamic State extremists in Libya.
Officials of the Tunisian government
are especially worried
after dozens of tourists were killed
in the attacks in Tunisia last year.
Defense Minister Farhat Horchani
said last week
that German and American security experts

News Report Three
Three university students
in Santiago, Chile,
have developed a plant-powered device
to charge their mobile phones.
The three engineering students
got the idea for the device
while sitting in their school's courtyard.
Their invention
is a small biological circuit
they call E-Kaia.
It captures the energy
which plants produce
during photosynthesis—
a process of converting sunlight
into energy.
A plant uses only
a small part of the energy
produced by that process.
The rest goes into the soil.
E-Kaia collects that energy.
The device plugs into the ground
and then into a mobile phone.
The E-Kaia solved two problems
for the engineering students.
They needed an idea for a class project.
They also needed an outlet
to plug in their phones.
One of the student inventors,
Camila Rupcich,
says the device changes the energy
released from the plant
into low-level power to charge phones.
The E-Kaia is able to fully recharge
a mobile phone
in less than two hours.

people were looking on in horror
as the child's mother,
identified by sources as Maria Zamara,
stood frozen in shock.
In the distance,
people could see
the train rounding a bend,
headed into the station.
I guess you were not aware
of any of these, right?

Passage One
There's one sound
that gets a big reaction from kids
on a hot day,
the sound of an ice-cream truck.
Maria McCartney
has been in the mobile ice-cream business
since 2005.
"When I was a little girl,
I saw an ice-cream truck
and knew I wanted to have one someday,"
McCartney said.
During the hot days of summer,
Maria and her daughter
drive an ice-cream truck
through neighborhoods and parks
in Billings.
It's not about making money
for this former elementary school teacher.
Rather,
she wants to preserve the tradition
of the neighborhood ice-cream truck.
"Truly my favorite part
is to see the kids
jumping up and down
and they just get so excited.
It's great
to build a memory for them too.
There's not
a lot of these ice-cream trucks
around anymore.
The parents come out
barefoot and screaming,
ready to buy ice-cream;
they remember when they were kids
and they saw a truck,"
she said.
While the treats may be ice cold,
Maria has a warm heart for little faces.
Her truck features a donation bucket
for kids who don't have money
for ice-cream.
"When there are three kids
and only two of them have money,
I always make sure
the third one gets something
because I can't drive away
and have that third one
not have something,"
she said.
Questions 16 to 18
are based on the passage
you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say
about Maria McCartney?
17. Why does Maria
go into the mobile ice-cream business?
18. Why does Maria
put a donation bucket
in her truck?
Passage Two
We know we have to pay
for what we get.
If we buy food,
we have to pay for it.
If a doctor treats us,
we know
there will be a bill to pay.
These are private bills.
But there are also public bills
to be paid.
They are paid by the government.
In turn
we get the needed services.
We pay for these services
through taxes.
What would happen
if everyone stopped paying taxes?
The water supply would stop;
the streets might not be cleaned;
schools would be closed.
We would not want to live
in such a city.
The chief duty of every government
is to protect persons and property.
More than three-fourths
of government expenses
are used for this purpose.
The next largest amount of public money
goes to teach and train our citizens.
Billions of dollars each year
are spent on schools and libraries.
Also, a large amount of public funds
is spent on roads.
Most of the needed funds
is raised by taxes.
The law orders us to pay taxes.
We have no choice in the matter.
Years ago
the government made money
by selling public lands.
But most of the best public lands
have now been sold.
There are still some public lands
that contain oil, coal
and other natural resources.
They could be sold,
but we want to save them
for future years.
So, we all must pay our share
for the services
that make our lives comfortable.
Questions 19 to 21
are based on the passage
you have just heard.
19. What does the speaker
mainly talk about?
20. What is most of the government money
used for?
21. How did the government raise money
to pay public bills in the past?
Passage Three
Did you know that,
besides larger places
like France and Germany,
Europe is home
to several extremely tiny countries?
One of these countries contains less
than a square mile of land.
Another is surrounded on all sides
by Italy.
Yet each is an independent land,
with its own government, trade, and customs.
One of the best known
of these small countries
is Monaco.
It is situated on the Mediterranean Sea
and surrounded by France
on three sides.
Monaco became familiar to Americans
when its ruler, Prince Rainier,
married the American actress Grace Kelly.
Rainier's family
has ruled Monaco
almost continuously since 1297.
The land has been independent
for over three hundred years.
Andorra,
with an area of some 200 square miles,
is considerably larger than Monaco.
This country is located
in the Pyrenees Mountains,
with France on one side
and Spain on the other.
Potatoes and tobacco are grown
in Andorra's steep mountain valleys.
One of the products it exports
is clothing.
Andorra is also known
for its excellent skiing locations.
Within the Alps in Central Europe
is Liechtenstein,
a tiny country of about 30,000 people
who speak mostly German.
Liechtenstein uses the same money
as its neighbor Switzerland,
but it has been an independent country
since the 1860s.
Taxes are low,
so many businesses
have their headquarters here.
The country makes and exports
a lot of machinery.
Other small, independent states in Europe
are San Marino and Luxembourg.
Each of these has unique qualities as well.
Questions 22 to 25
are based on the passage
you have just heard.
22. What does the speaker say
about Monaco?
23. Why did Monaco
become familiar to Americans
according to the speaker?
24. What is one of the products
Andorra exports?
25. What does the speaker
mainly talk about?

W: What time do you start?
M: I work 9 to 3. Then I start again at 5:30 and work until 11.
Six days a week. So I have to work very unsocial hours.
W: And do you have to work at the weekend?
M: Oh, yes, that's our busiest time. I get Wednesdays off.
W: What are the things you have to do,
and the things you don't have to do?
M: Eh, I don't have to do the washing-up, so that's good.
I have to wear white
and I have to keep everything in the kitchen totally clean.
W: What's hard about the job?
M: You're standing up all the time.
When we're busy, people get angry and sharp.
But that's normal.
W: How did you learn the profession?
M: Well, I did a two-year course at college.
In the first year, we had to learn the basics.
And then we had to take exams.
W: Was it easy to find a job?
M: I wrote to about six hotels.
And one of them gave me my first job.
So I didn't have to wait too long.

about the pocket money children in Britain get?
M: Yes. I thought it was quite interesting,
but I don't quite understand the column entitled "Change".
Can you explain what it means?
W: Well, I think it means the change from the year before.
I am not a mathematician,
but I assume the rise from 72p to 90p is a rise of 25 percent.
M: Oh, yes. I see. And the inflation rate is there for comparison.
W: Yes.
Why do you think the rise in pocket money
is often higher than inflation?
M: I am sorry I've no idea.
Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.
W: Perhaps they are.
But it looks as if children were not better off in 2001
than they were in 2002.
That's strange, isn't it?
And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now.
I wonder why that is.
M: Yes. I don't understand that at all.
W: Anyway, if you had children,
how much pocket money would you give them?
M: I don't know. I think I'll probably give them 2 pounds a week.
W: Would you? And what would you expect them to do with it?
M: Well, out of that,
they'd have to buy some small personal things,
but I wouldn't expect them to save to buy their own socks, for example.

Passage One
As the new sales director for a national computer firm,
Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting
with the company's district managers.
Everyone arrived on time,
and Alex's presentation went extremely well.
He decided to end the meeting with the conversation
about the importance of the district managers to the company's plans.
"I believe we are going to continue to increase our share of the market,"
he began, "because of the quality of the people in this room.
The district manager is the key to the success
of the sales representatives in his district.
He sets the term for everyone else.
If he has ambitious goals and is willing to put in long hours,
everyone in his unit will follow his example."
When Alex was finished, he received polite applause,
but hardly the warm response he had hoped for.
Later he spoke with one of the senior managers.
"Things were going so well until the end,"
Alex said disappointedly. "Obviously, I said the wrong thing."
"Yes," the district manager replied.
"Half of our managers are women.
Most have worked their way up from sales representatives,
and they are very proud of the role
they've played in the company's growth.
They don't care at all about political correctness.
But they were definitely surprised and distressed
to be referred to as 'he' in your speech."
Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
Question 16: Who did Alex Gordon speak to at the first meeting?
Question 17: What did Alex want to emphasize at the end of his presentation?
Question 18: What do we learn about the audience at the meeting?
Question 19: Why did Alex fail to receive the warm response he had hoped for?
Passage Two
The way to complain is to act business-like and important.
If your complaint is immediate,
suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant,
make a polite but firm request to see the manager.
When the manager comes, ask his or her name.
And then state your problem and what you expect to have done about it.
Be polite!
Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere.
But also be firm in making your complaint.
Besides, act important.
This doesn't mean to put on airs and say
"do you know who I am?"
What it means is that people are often treated the way
they expect to be treated.
If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be granted,
chances are it will be granted.
The worst way to complain is over the telephone.
You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see.
So you can't tell how the person on the line is reacting.
It is easy for that person to give you the run-around.
Complaining in person or by letter is generally more effective.
If your complaint doesn't require an immediate response,
it often helps to complain by letter.
If you have an appliance that doesn't work,
send a letter to the store that sold it.
Be business-like and stick to the point.
Don't spend a paragraph on
how your uncle Joe tried to fix the problem and couldn't.
Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
Question 20: What does the speaker suggest you do
when you are not served properly at a restaurant?
Question 21: Why does the speaker say the worst way
to complain is over the telephone?
Question 22: What should you do if you make a complaint by letter?
Passage Three
Barbara Sanders is a wife and the mother of two children, ages 2 and 4.
Her husband, Tom, is an engineer and makes an excellent salary.
Before Barbara had children,
she worked as an architect for the government,
designing government housing.
She quit her job when she became pregnant,
but is now interested in returning to work.
She's been offered an excellent job with the government.
Her husband feels it's unnecessary for her to work
since the family does not need the added income.
He also thinks that a woman should stay home with her children.
If Barbara feels the need to do socially important work,
he thinks that she should do volunteer work one or two days a week.
Barbara, on the other hand,
has missed the excitement of her profession
and does not feel she would be satisfied doing volunteer work.
She would also like to have her own income,
so she does not have to ask her husband for money
whenever she wants to buy something.
She does not think
it's necessary to stay home every day with the children
and she knows a very reliable baby-sitter
who's willing to come to her house.
Tom does not think a baby-sitter can replace a mother
and thinks it's a bad idea for the children
to spend so much time with someone
who's not part of the family.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
Question 23: What was Barbara's profession before she had children?
Question 24: What does Barbara's husband suggest she do
 if she wants to work?
Question 25: What does Tom think about hiring a baby-sitter?
This is the end of listening comprehension.

Part II Listening Comprehension
Section A
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three news reports.
At the end of each news report,
you will hear two or three questions.
Both the news report and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

News Report One
The International Labour Organization
says the number of people without jobs is increasing.
In its latest update on Global Employment Trends,
the agency says projections of the number of unemployed people this year
range from 210 million to nearly 240 million people.
The report warns that 200 million poor workers
are at risk of joining the ranks of people
living on less than 2 dollars per day in the past three years.
The director general of the International Labour Organization, 
Juan Somavia,notes that some countries have taken measures
to address the effects of the global crisis.
However, he points out
that many countries have not done so.
And based on past experiences,
it takes four to five years after economic recovery
for unemployment to return to pre-crisis levels.
Mr. Somavia says the International Labour Organization
is proposing a global jobs' agreement
to deal with unemployment.
"Its key objective is to place the center of recovery efforts,
measures that would generate higher levels of employment
and provide basic social protection for the most vulnerable."
Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. What is the news report mainly about?

2. What does Juan Somavia,
director general of the International Labour Organization, say?


News Report Two
Big fast-food chains in New York City
have started to obey a first-of-its-kind rule
requiring them to post calorie counts right on the menu.
Cathy Nonas is with the New York City Department of Health.
"We wanted to give people an opportunity
to actually see the calories before they purchase the food
and make a decision, an informed decision,
that if they want to make the healthier choice,
if they want to eat fewer calories, they can.
And we expect this will have a huge impact on obesity.
And of course, if it has an impact on obesity,
it will have an impact on diabetes, 
and heart disease, and high blood pressure."
The new rules were introduced
as part of an anti-obesity campaign
that also includes a recent citywide ban
on artificial trans-fats in restaurant food.
The menu rule only applies to restaurants
that serve standardized portion sizes
and have 15 or more locations nationwide.
Starting last Saturday, chains big enough to fall under the rule
will face penalties of up to 2000 dollars
for not showing calorie information in a prominent spot on their menus,
preferably next to the price.
Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
3. What are big fast food chains in New York City
required to do according to the new rule?

4. What will happen to big restaurant chains that violate the new rule?


News Report Three
Almost all companies recognize the importance of innovation today.
But not many are able to integrate innovation into their business.

A commentary in the Shanghai Daily
points out that innovation doesn't mean piles of documents.
It is something more practical.
The article says many people tend to assume that innovation
just means creating something new,
but actually it's more than that.
It's an attitude of doing things.
A company should find ways to innovate
not just in products 
but also in functions, business models and processes.

The article cites the global giant Procter & Gamble as an example,
saying a real innovative company should develop an innovation culture
and use it as a primary tool for success.
Procter & Gamble has a "Corporate Innovation Fund"
which offers big rewards for high-risk ideas that succeed.
It also has a special innovation facility for its employees.
Sometimes its employees are released from their daily jobs for weeks
and spend their time interacting in the innovation facility instead.
In conclusion, 
the article says innovative ideas alone do not ensure success.
It's pointless unless there is repeatable process in place
to turn inspiration into financial performance.
Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. What is the problem with many companies 
according to the news report?

6. What do many people tend to think of innovation?

7. What does the company Procter & Gamble owe its success to?


Section B
Directions: In this section,
you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation,
you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

Conversation One
M: So, Lyndsay, do you like to text message on your cell phone?
W: Yeah, I text message a lot.
M: I don't do it so much. 
I prefer to make a call if I'm in a hurry.
W: Yeah, I go both ways. 
Sometimes I don't really want to talk to the person.
I just want to ask them one question,
so it's much easier for me just to text message.
If I call them, I'll have to have a long conversation.
M: Yeah, I can see what you mean.
But I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call.
I'm not a big talker.
W: Yeah, that's true. You don't talk a lot.
M: So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb?
W: Well, when I first got a cell phone, I was so slow.
I thought I would never text message.
But then people kept text messaging me,
so I felt obliged to learn how to text message.
So now I'm pretty fast. What about you?
M: Actually I have the opposite problem.
When I first got my cell phone,
I thought it was so cool 
to text message all my friends who have one,
and I was pretty fast with my thumb then.
But it seems like now I don't use it so much, 
I've got slower actually.
W: Yeah, I think text messaging 
actually sort of has to do with your age.
For example, people in high school, 
they text message a lot.
But I asked my father if he text messages, 
and guess what he said?
M: What?
W: He said he never text messaged.
He thinks it's very childish and unprofessional to text message.
M: Yeah, I can see what he means.
It's considered pretty informal to text message someone.

Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you've just heard.
8. What does the man say about himself?

9. What does the woman tend to do while she is on the phone?

10. Why did the man text message all his friends 
when he first got his cell phone?

11. What does the woman's father think of text messaging?


Conversation Two
W: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How can I help you?
M: Well, I'd like to talk to you about Tim Bond, 
the department manager.
W: What seems to be the problem?
M: Well, ever since Sandra left the department,
I feel like I've been targeted to do all her work as well as mine.
I'm expected to attend too many meetings
and I seem to be spending a lot of my time 
doing unnecessary paperwork.
W: I'm sorry to hear that.
M: And, on top of that, I'd specifically asked 
if I could leave early last Friday
as I'd done a lot of overtime during the week.
But that afternoon, even though I'd finished my assigned work,
I was told to help other colleagues finish their work, too.
W: But surely that's a positive sign
showing that Mr. Bond has a lot of trust in you.
M: Yes, but other colleagues get to leave early,
and they don't have such a lot of work to do.
W: So you feel he's been making unrealistic demands on you?
M: Yes, absolutely.
W: Have you approached Mr. Bond about this particular problem?
M: I've tried, but it seems like he just has no time for me.
W: Well, at this stage, 
it would be better if you approached him directly.
If nothing else showing that you've tried to solve the problem yourself,
before you take it further, 
makes it clear that you're not just a complainer.
Why don't you send an email 
requesting a meeting with him in private?
M: Hmm, I've been a bit worried about his reaction.
But anyway, I'll send him an email to request a meeting,
and I'll see what happens from there. 
Thanks for your advice.
W: Good luck and let us know the outcome.

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
12. What do we learn about the man from the conversation?

13. What is the man's chief complaint?

14. How does the woman interpret the fact
that the man was asked to help his colleagues with their work?

15. What did the woman advise the man to do?


Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
The massive decline in sleep 
happened so slowly and quietly
that few seemed to notice the trend.
Was it because of the growing attraction of the Internet, 
video games and endless TV channels?
Never disconnecting from work?
No matter how it happened, millions of  Americans
are putting their health, quality of life 
and even length of life in danger.
New evidence shows why getting enough sleep 
is a top priority.
Some 40 percent of Americans 
get less than seven hours of shut-eye on weeknights.
"The link between sleep and health, 
and bad sleep and disease,
is becoming clearer and clearer,"
says Lawrence Epstein, a sleep expert at Harvard University.
For example, sleep duration has declined 
from some eight hours in the 1950s to seven in recent years.
At the same time, high blood pressure 
has become an increasing problem.
Blood pressure and heart rate
are typically at their lowest levels during sleep;
people who sleep less
tend to have higher blood pressure,  
heart attack, diabetes, weight gain and other problems.
Sleeping better may help fight off illness.
"When people are sleep-deprived,
there are higher levels of stress hormones in their bodies,
which can decrease immune function,"
says Dr. Phyllis Zee of Northwestern University in Chicago.
A University of Chicago study
shows people who sleep well live longer.
So say good night sooner,
and it may help you stay active and vital to a ripe old age.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What is the speaker mainly talking about?

17. What do we learn from the talk about today's Americans?

18. What does the speaker say will happen to people who lack sleep?


Passage Two
Parents and teachers will tell you
not to worry when applying for a place at university.
But in the same breath will remind you
that it is the most important decision of your life.

The first decision is your choice of course.
It will depend on what you want to get out of university,
what you are good at and what you enjoy.
The next decision is where to apply.
Aim high but within reason.
Do you have the right combination of subjects
and are your expected grades likely to meet entry requirements?
The deadline is January 15th.
But it is best to submit your application early
because universities begin work as soon as forms start rolling in.

The most important part of the application
is the much feared personal statement.
This is your chance to convey boundless enthusiasm for the subject.
So economy of expression is foremost.
Omit dull and ineffective generalities
and make sure you give concrete examples.

Admissions officers read every personal statement that arrives.
It is not convincing if you say you have chosen the subject 
because you enjoy it.
You have to get across what it is about a particular area
that has inspired you.
They will look for evidence 
that you have reflected and thought about the subject.

Applicants should be honest.
There is no point saying you run marathons,
if you are going to be out of breath arriving at the interview 
on the second floor.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What is the first decision you should make
in preparing to apply for a place at university?

20. What is the most important part of the application?

21. What must applicants do in their personal statements?


Passage Three
It is uaually agreed
that a German, Carl Benz, built the first motor car in 1885.
It was actually a tricycle with a petrol motor at the rear.
Soon, members of the Royal family and other wealthy people
took up motoring as a sport.
Many of the early cars had 2 seats.
There were no petrol pumps and few garages,
so every driver had to be his own engineer 
for the frequent breakdowns.

By 1905, cars began to look like cars of today,
with headlamps, windscreen, rubber tyres and number plates.
Henry Ford's "Model T", introduced in America in 1909,
was cheaper because it was made on the assembly line.
It brought cars closer towards the reach of "ordinary people".
With the popularity of the car,
registration became a must in 1903
with the Motor Car Act.
Competency tests were introduced in 1935.

Today, the legal driving age for a car in the UK is seventeen.
You are not allowed to drive a car unsupervised
until you have passed a driving test.
In 1958, Britain celebrated the opening of its first motorway --- 
the Preston bypass.
Until then, no one really understood what a motorway was,
not even the labourers who were building it.
The bypass hailed a new era in motor travel
and was greeted with excitement and optimism.
Service stations came with the motorway
and the legend of the transport café was born.
Of course, the service station has diversified greatly.
But whether it's an English cooked breakfast 
or a coffee and sandwich,
one thing has remained the same: the prices.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What does the speaker say about the first motor car?

23. What was the problem with the early cars in Britain?

24. Why did Henry Ford's "Model T" cars cost less?

25. What do we learn about the Preston bypass?


This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

you will hear three news reports.
At the end of each news report,
you will hear two or three questions.
Both the news report and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

News Report One
You probably think college students are experts at sleeping. 
But parties, preparations for tests, personal problems and general stress 
can wreck a student's sleep habits, 
which can be bad for the body and the mind.
Texas Tech University is even offering a class 
called "Improving Your Sleep Habits". 
People suffering from sleep loss 
are adding increased risk from obesity, 
psychological problems and car crashes. 
Students who don't get enough sleep 
have poorer attendance and lower grades. 
On top of all that, 
a new study published in the journal Learning & Memory 
finds you are probably better off sleeping 
than making last-minute preparations for a test. 
Two hundred college kids 
were taught to play some unfamiliar video games. 
Subjects who learned the game in the morning 
lost some skills when they played again 12 hours later, 
but they did much better after getting a good night sleep. 
So, if you really want to do your job well, 
don't forget to get some sleep.

Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report 
you have just heard.
1.What is the news report mainly about?

2.What is the finding of the new study 
published in the journal Learning & Memory?


News Report Two
Long queues, delayed flights and overcrowding at airports 
have become almost as much a topic for conversation in Britain 
as the traditional complaining about the weather. 
Meanwhile, there are complaints 
that poor service at London's major airports 
is discouraging foreigners from doing business in Britain. 
Much of the criticism is directed at the British Airports Authority, 
which runs seven major airports, 
including the three main ones serving London. 
The Competition Commission is now to investigate 
whether the British Airports Authority 
need to sell off some of its assets. 
The idea is that competition between rival operators 
would lead to better service at airports. 
The British Airports Authority, recently bought by a Spanish company, 
says the root cause of the problem is not the ownership structure 
but a lack of runway and terminal capacity, 
which it is addressing through a programm of heavy investment.

Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report 
you have just heard.
3.What is the Competition Commission going to investigate?

4.What is the root cause of the poor service at British airports 
according to the British Airports Authority?


News Report Three
Under the law in Massachusetts, 
tobacco companies have to measure the nicotine content
 of every type of cigarette and report the results. 
The Department of Public Health in Boston 
gathers and carefully examines the figures 
and then draws its conclusion. 
A hundred and sixteen brands were looked at for the study. 
Ninety two were found to have higher nicotine yields 
than they did six years previously. 
The biggest increases tended to be 
in brands that were popular with young smokers. 
That worries the department 
because of the addictive nature of nicotine. 
Stand Glance, a professor of medicine in San Francisco, 
explains why: 
"The amount of nicotine that is delivered in every cigarette 
is ten percent higher than it was six year ago,
which means that is easier to get hooked and harder to quit. 
The big tobacco companies have always insisted 
that they are frank with their customers about the dangers of smoking 
and provide them with enough detail to make an informed decision. 
However, none of them were prepared to comment on this study 
or discuss the detailed nicotine content of their products."
Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report 
you have just heard.
5. What do tobacco companies have to do under the law in Massachusetts?

6. What do we learn from the study by the Department of Public Health in Boston?

7. What do we learn from the news report about the big tobacco companies?



Section B
Directions: In this section,
you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation,
you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

Conversation One
M: And you know one thing that I wanted to ask you. 
It is great that you have had this experience of teaching in Indonesia 
and following up on what you just mentioned, 
what would you recommend 
for students who do not live in an English-speaking country? 
And, you know, they want to learn. 
I don't know about perfecting, 
but they want at least to be able to communicate decently. 
How can they go about this?
W: Yeah, it is really hard. 
That's the real struggle 
because right now I do live in Holland 
but I really don't socialize much with Dutch people. 
And my boyfriend's English is so good 
that we just basically speak English all the time. 
So I have to make a real effort to practice. 
There's as much listening exposure as I want. 
All I have to do is turn on the TV.
M: And reading also, right?
W: Yeah, reading. There's plenty I can get to read and listen to. 
But for speaking, there really is no substitute 
for trying to speak and use the language 
in a relaxed atmosphere.
 So I think that is really the challenge for people 
who live in a country where their target language isn't spoken. 
And for that, gosh, what would I do? 
If I didn't have people here, 
probably try to find a club? 
In Sweden, they have a really cool system called study circles where not… 
It's like a course, 
but really you just have a course leader,
who is there, sort of, as a coaching guide 
and to help out.
And you don't get grade, 
and you go just because you want to learn.

Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation 
you have just heard.
8. Where does the woman live right now?

9. What does the woman say is the real challenge?

10. What does the woman suggest doing 
to learn to speak a foreign language?

11. What does the woman say about the study circles in Sweden?



Conversation Two
W: OK, Nathan. So we are talking about driving 
and are there any rules or regulations 
that you'd like to change?
M: I'm not sure I want to change rules.
 But I'd like the police to be stricter on the rules. 
Like if people jump the traffic lights, 
I don't know why there isn't a camera 
at the traffic lights to stop people doing that. Or like speeding. 
It is very easy to put speed cameras in certain places.
W: Maybe car manufacturers 
should have some responsibility in limiting the power of their engines. 
What's the point in producing an engine 
that is big and powerful enough to go like 200 km/h 
when the speed limit is only 100?
M: Right. But do you know there are no speed limits in Germany?
W: People there do drive responsibly, though. 
Often, people break laws simply because the laws are there.
If the law isn't there, 
people will drive within their ability range. 
When you've got speed limit, 
this creates situation 
that actually presents dangers on the road.
M: Do you think Germans have better education 
about personal responsibility when driving?
W: Possibly. They also have very good cars.
M: Right.
W: If you've got a good car that can go at high speed, 
then it's really nice to do that.
M: But still with care.
W: So I think it is the restriction 
that creates the dangers sometimes.
M: OK.
W: Obviously, when driving through a residential area 
or where there is a school, 
you've got to have speed policeman.
M: Speed bumps.
W: Yes, speed bumps, 
those speed bumps that force you to slow down. 
I think they're good idea.
M: So you don't think fining people is useful?
W: Not really because the police don't have time 
to police every single driver.

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
you have just heard.
12. What are the speakers mainly talking about?

13. What does the woman think car manufacturers could do?

14. What can we learn about people driving in Germany?

15. What does the woman think of the police fining drivers?


Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Behind the cash register 
at a store in downtown San Francisco, 
Sam Azar swiped his credit card 
to pay for a pack of cigarettes. 
The store's card reader 
failed to scan the card's magnetic strip. 
Azar tried again and again. No luck. 
As customers began to queue, 
Mr. Azar reached beneath the counter 
for a black plastic bag. 
He wrapped one layer of the plastic around the card 
and tried again. Success. 
The sale was completed. 
"I don't know how it works. It just does." 
said Mr. Azar who learned the trick from another clerk.
Verifone, the company that makes the store's card reader, 
would not confirm or deny 
that the plastic bag trick worked. 
But it's one of many low-tech fixes for high-tech failures 
that people without engineering degrees have discovered, 
often out of desperation, and shared. 
Today's shaky economy
 is likely to produce many more such tricks. 
"In post-war Japan, 
the economy wasn't doing so great 
so you couldn't get everyday-use items 
like household cleaners," 
says Lisa Katayama, author of Urawaza, 
a book named after the Japanese term 
for clever lifestyle tips and tricks. 
"So people looked for ways to do with what they had."
Today, Americans are finding their own tips and tricks 
for fixing malfunctioning devices 
with supplies as simple as paper and glue. 
Some, like Mr. Azar's plastic bag, 
are opened to argument as to how they work 
or whether they really work at all. 
But many tech home remedies can be explained by a little science.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
you have just heard.
16. What happened when Sam Azar swiped his credit card 
to pay for his purchase?

17. How did Sam Azar manage to complete the sale?

18. What is today's shaky economy likely to do?


Passage Two
If you are a graduate student, 
you may depend on your adviser for many things, 
including help with improving grades, 
acquiring financial support, 
forming an examining committee 
and getting letters of recommendation. 
If you are a graduate teaching assistant, 
your adviser also may be your "boss". 
Academic departments vary in their procedures 
for assigning academic advisers to graduate students. 
In some departments, 
either the chairman or the director of graduate studies 
serves for at least the first semester 
as a new student adviser. 
Then students select an adviser, 
based on shared academic interests. 
In other departments, 
a new student is assigned a faculty adviser 
based on some system of distribution 
of the department's "advising load". 
Later, students may have the opportunity 
of selecting the adviser that they prefer. 
In any case, new graduate students 
can learn who their advisers or temporary advisers are 
by visiting or emailing the departmental office 
and asking for the information. 
Graduation requirements 
specify the number of credits you must earn, 
the minimum grade point average you must achieve 
and the distribution of credits you must have 
from among differing departments or fields of study. 
In addition, it is necessary to apply for graduation 
when you near that time 
that you will be completing your graduation requirements. 
Since graduation requirements vary 
among divisions of the university, 
you should consult the Bulletin of Information. 
You should also direct your questions 
to your departmental office or academic adviser.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
you have just heard.
19. What does the speaker say 
about the procedures for assigning academic advisers?

20. How can new graduate students learn who their advisers are?

21. What does the speaker say about graduation requirements?


Passage Three
Jody Hubbard is a diet and nutrition expert 
who travels around the state 
to speak in middle and high schools. 
She primarily speaks to students in health classes, 
but sometimes the school will arrange for her 
to speak to several different groups of girls. 
Her biggest concern is the emphasis 
American culture places on thinness 
and the negative way that affects girls today. 
Jody has a Ph.D. in nutrition, but, more important, 
she has personal experience. 
Her mother taught her to diet 
when she was only 8 years old. 
Jody has created several different presentations, 
which she gives to different types of audiences 
and she tries to establish an emotional connection 
with the students so that 
they will feel comfortable asking questions 
or talking to her privately. 
She shows them pictures and images 
from popular culture of beautiful women and explains 
how computers are used 
to make the women look even more thin and "beautiful" 
than they are in real life. 
She describes how the definition of beauty 
has changed over the years 
and even from culture to culture. 
She then talks about health issues 
and the physical damage 
that can occur as a result of dieting. 
Finally, she addresses self-respect 
and the notion that a person's sense of beauty 
must include more than how much a person weighs. 
Sometimes Jody feels 
that she succeeds in persuading some students to stop dieting; 
other times she feels that she fails.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
you have just heard.
22. Who does Jody Hubbard primarily speak to?

23. What is Jody Hubbard's biggest concern about American culture?

24. Why does Jody Hubbard 
show pictures of beautiful women to her audiences?

25. What is Jody Hubbard's main purpose in giving her speeches?


This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

News Report One
Officials in Thailand found 40 dead tiger cubs
at a Buddhist temple accused of animal abuse.
The dead cubs were discovered Wednesday
in a freezer at the temple, west of Bangkok.
Authorities found them
while removing dozens of mostly full-grown live tigers
from the temple grounds.
Officials said the cubs appeared to be about a week old.
It was not known why they were in the freezer,
where temple staff kept food.
Monks have been operating an unsanctioned zoo, called Tiger Temple.
Tourists paid money to view and take pictures
with the tigers and other exotic animals.
Thai authorities plan to file charges against the temple
for illegally possessing endangered species.

News Report Two
Switzerland has opened the world's longest and deepest railway tunnel,
17 years after starting work on the project.
The Gotthard Railway Tunnel is 57 kilometers long.
Trains passing through it will be about 2.3 kilometers underground
at the deepest point.
The tunnel cost 12 billion dollars to build
under the Alps of central Switzerland.
The tunnel will reduce the time it takes trains to travel
between northern and southern Europe.
It is also expected to lower the number of vehicles on roads,
and move cargo between north and south.
The two-way tunnel opens for commercial service in December.
When that happens,
up to 260 freight trains and 65 passenger trains
will be able to pass through it every day.
Question 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.

A Japanese boy named Yamato Tanooka remains missing four days
after his parents abandoned him as a punishment, police said.
Japan's military joined the search Wednesday for the 7-year-old boy
missing in a forest in northern Japan.
But on Wednesday night, the boy still had not been found.
About 275 soldiers, police and volunteers searched for him Wednesday.
The boy has been missing since Saturday,
when his parents made him get out of their car to punish him
for throwing rocks at cars and people, according to police.
Kyodo News Service said police are looking into
whether the parents should be charged with child abandonment.
Child psychiatrists said even a threat of leaving a child behind
is child abuse because of the stress it creates.
Police said the boy's father, Takayuki Tanooka,
returned to the area to look for his son a few minutes later,
but could not find him.
Tanooka first told police his son disappeared
while the family was picking vegetables.
He later said that
he and his wife had punished their son for bad behavior.
Question 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. How was the boy missing?
6. Who searched for the boy four days
after his parents abandoned him?

Section B
Directions: In this section,
you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation,
you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
W: Hello, Parkson College. May I help you?
M: Yes.
I'm looking for information on courses in computer programming.
I would need it for the fall semester.
W: Do you want a day or evening course?
M: Well, it would have to be an evening course
since I work during the day.
W: Aha. Have you taken any courses in data processing?
M: No.
W: Oh. Well, data processing is a course you have to take
before you can take computer programming.
M: Oh, I see. Well, when is it given? I hope it's not on Thursdays.
W: Well, there's a class that meets on Monday evenings at seven.
M: Just once a week?
W: Yes.
But that's almost three hours from seven to nine forty-five.
M: Oh. Well, that's alright.
I could manage that. How many weeks does the course last?
W: Mmmm, let me see. Twelve weeks.
You start the first week in September,
and finish, oh, just before Christmas. December 21st.
M: And how much is the course?
W: That's three hundred dollars including the necessary computer time.
M: Aha. Okay. Ah, where do I go to register?
W: Registration is on the second and third of September,
between 6:00 and 9:00 in Frost Hall.
M: Is that the round building behind the parking lot?
W: Yes. That's the one.
M: Oh, I know how to get there.
Is there anything that I should bring with me?
W: No, just your checkbook.
M: Well, thank you so much.
W: You are very welcome. Bye!
M: Bye!
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
8. Why does the man choose to take an evening course?
9. What does the man have to do
before taking the course of computer programming?
10. What do we learn about the schedule of the evening course?
11. What does the man want to know at the end of the conversation?
Conversation Two
W: So why exactly does your job have a reputation for being stressful?
M: Stress is generally driven
by the feeling of being out of control of a situation
and the feeling of a situation controlling you.
Trading in financial markets combines both.
W: How do you relax in the evening?
M: I very rarely do anything work-related
so it's easy to escape "The Markets".
I generally go to the gym or go for a run,
especially if I've had a bad day.
I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away
to do something my brain would regard as creative.
W: Do you think what you do to relax is an effective way to beat stress?
M: I don't think there's a specific rule about how to beat stress.
I generally find that what I do is effective for me.
W: Would you consider changing your job
because of the high stress factor?
M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors.
However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing,
and if used the right way, can actually be a positive thing.
W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?
M: Having said all that, I do enjoy an element of uncertainty.
I enjoy a mental challenge.
Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second.
How you deal with and manage those emotions,
dictates short, medium and long term trading performance and success.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three ot four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea
of life existing somewhere else besides earth.
Until recently, scientists believed that
life on other planets was just a hopeful dream.
But now they are beginning to locate places where life could form.
In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun.
But scientists now think that
life could be even nearer in our own solar system.
One place scientists are studying very closely is Europa, a moon of Jupiter.
Space probes have provided evidence that
Europa has a large ocean under its surface.
The probes have also made scientists think that
under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat.
Water and heat from volcanic activity
are two basic conditions needed for life to form.
A third is certain basic chemicals such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.
Scientists believe there might be such chemicals
lying at the bottom of Europa's ocean.
They may have already created life, or may be about to.
You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form.
Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential.
But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness,
such as caves several miles beneath the surface, and bacteria,
primitive forms of life, have been seen there.
So the lack of light in Europa's subsurface ocean
doesn't automatically rule out life forming.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What did scientists once believe according to the passage?
17. What have scientists found about Europa, a moon of Jupiter?
18. What have scientists come to know recently about the formation of life?
Passage Two
In her early days as an emergency room physician,
Dr. Joanna Meyer treated a child
who had suffered a second degree burn.
After the child had been treated,
and was being prepared for discharge,
Dr.Meyer talked to the parents about
how they should care for the child at home.
Also listening to her were a half dozen other family members.
A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye,
the family asked her to settle an argument
they've been having over exactly what advice she had given.
"As I talked to them, I was amazed," she said.
"All of them had heard the simple instructions
I had given just a few hours before.
But they had three or four different versions.
The most basic details were unclear and confusing.
I was surprised, because these were intelligent people."
This episode gave Dr. Meyer her first clue
to something every doctor learns sooner or later-
most people just don't listen very well.
Nowadays, she says, she repeats her instructions,
and even conducts a reality check with some patients:
she asks them to tell her what they think they're supposed to do.
She also provides take-home sheets,
which are computer printouts tailored to the patients' situation.
Dr. Meyer's listeners are not unusual.
When new or difficult material is presented,
almost all listeners are faced with a challenge
because human speech lacks the stability
and permanence of the printed word.
Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What did the child's family members argue about in the hospital?
20. What does Dr. Meyer do
to ensure her patients understand her instructions?
21. What does the speaker say about human speech?
Passage Three
It is logical to suppose that
things like good labour relations, good working conditions,
good wages and benefits, and job security motivate workers.
But one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that
such conditions do not motivate workers.
They are merely "satisfiers".
"Motivators", in contrast, include things
such as having a challenging and interesting job,
recognition and responsibility.
However, even with the development of computers and robotics,
there are always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs,
and lots of unskilled people who have to do them.
So how do managers motivate people in such jobs?
One solution is to give them some responsibilities,
not as individuals but as part of a team.
For example, some supermarkets combine office staff,
the people who fill the shelves,
and the people who work at the checkout into a team,
and let them decide what product lines to stock,
how to display them, and so on.
Many people now talk about the importance
of a company's shared values or culture,
with which all the staff can identify:
for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best,
the most user-friendly or the most reliable products in a particular field.
Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets,
which ultimately only concern a few people.
Unfortunately, there is only a limited number of such goals to go round,
and by definition, not all the competing companies in an industry
can seriously claim to be the best.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What can actually motivate workers according to Frederick Herzberg?
23. What does the speaker say about jobs in the computer era?
24. What do some supermarkets do to motivate their employees?
25. Why does the speaker say financial targets
are less likely to motivate workers?
This is the end of listening comprehension.
Part II  Listening Comprehension
Section A
Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
At the end of each news report,
you will hear two or three questions.
Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
Last October, a NASA rocket,
traveling at a speed of 9,000 kilometers per hour,
smashed into a deep, dark hole on the moon's south pole.
Upon impact, the Centaur rocket kicked up a cloud of dust
and elements from the moon's surface,
creating a so-called "ejecta-plume"
that was monitored by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO.
Scientists analyzed the findings,
and preliminary results from this mission suggested
that there was some form of water on the moon.
NASA lunar scientist Michael Wargo said those days
that a wave of findings during the past year makes it certain.
 "We've confirmed that there was indeed water ice in the ejecta-plume,
and at an abundance that was about 50 percent
greater than our initial estimates."
That means that the impact site has more water than some deserts on Earth.
1. According to the news report, what has happened last October?
2. What did preliminary results from this mission suggest?
Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
An American government panel has recommended that pregnant women,
health-care workers, children and young adults up to the age of 24
should get priority for the flu vaccine released later this year.
But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
conceded the policy may change if not enough vaccine
is produced by October.
Doctor Ann Schuchat of the Center for Disease Control said
it is vital for pregnant women
who have breathing illness and fever to get early treatment.
We think some suitable medicines for them can be lifesaving,
and that's a very important message.
We also think it is important for them
to get seasonal influenza vaccine,
and today the committee recommended that
when vaccine is available,
and we have a decision to go forward that the pregnant women
really out of consider getting the H1N1 vaccine.
3. Who are less necessary to receive the flu vaccinations?
4. Why do pregnant women enjoy the top priority to get vaccine?
Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
Hundreds of residents and holidaymakers
along southern Australia's popular Great Ocean Road
were forced to move out on Thursday as hot,
windy weather threatened to recharge bushfires
that destroyed more than 100 homes on Christmas Day.
Residents in three coastal towns in the popular holiday area
were advised to leave their homes as temperatures
were forecast to reach a high of almost 40 degrees Celsius.
The hot summer weather threatened to expand fires
that have been burning for almost two weeks.
The fires were started by a lightning strike on Dec. 19
and continue to burn and spread.
The Country Fire Authority estimates the fire
has burnt out more than 25 square kilometers of land.
Authorities estimate that 116 homes
were destroyed by the fires on Christmas Day.
The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia's biggest tourist
draws with its spectacular scenery
and unusual offshore rock formations.
Parts of the road remained closed to traffic on Thursday
during what is typically one of its busiest times of the year.
5. What happened on Australia's Great Ocean Road on Thursday?
6. Why should the local residents leave their homes?
7. When did the bushfires start?
Section B
Directions: In this section,
you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation,
you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
W: Are you all ready for Christmas?
M: No, I haven't even started.
I've done zero shopping.
W: Well, you'd better get going.
Christmas is only a week away.
M: I have to tell you that I'm one of those people
who really get stressed out by the Christmas rush.
W: Oh, I'm not. I love the holidays.
I love the crowds, the shopping, the holidays, the music,
the food, the parties, and all the presents.
M: That's just the beginning.
My wife always spends too much money on Christmas.
That takes me till April to pay off all our Christmas bills.
W: Don't be a miser about it.
Think about your kids.
Didn't you use to love Christmas when you were a kid?
M: I guess so. I don't remember.
W: I know you did. You know, maybe Christmas is for kids,
but you can still enjoy it through the eyes of your children.
M: Well, kids enjoy it because they don't have to do all the shopping
and pay all the bills.
W: Maybe that's true. But you know as well as I do,
that Christmas is more than shopping and trees.
It's about what's in your heart and how you can make others happy.
M: You're right. You're absolutely right.
I'm going to try harder to be nice to people
and try to keep the true spirit of Christmas in my heart.
W: I'm glad to hear it.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
8. What does the woman try to do in the conversation?
9. When does the conversation take place?
10. What is the man's feeling about Christmas?
11. What will the man most probably do after the conversation?
Conversation Two
W: It's a lovely day today!
What would you like to do?
M: I really feel like doing something outdoors.
Perhaps we could go hill walking?
W: Mm, I'm not really in the mood for hill walking.
Why don't we just go swimming?
M: That suits me.
But it will take an hour or two.
Do you like to do something else first?
Maybe we could go cycling?
W: I don't think I enjoy that very much.
Actually I'm not a good cyclist.
Maybe we could have a meal at the new Italian restaurant.
M: That's fine for me. I haven't been to that restaurant yet.
So that's decided then.
A meal at the new Italian restaurant, then go to swim.
Great! So, when should we meet?
W: We'd better get to the restaurant a bit early
because it might be very busy.
I think we need to get there by 11:00.
M: Er, can I make it a little bit later, say, 11:20?
I have to visit my grandma this morning
and I don't think I can make it by then.
W: No problem. I'll go straight to the restaurant
at 11:00 and get you a table.
M: Great!
Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
12. Why doesn't the man want to go swimming?
13. What will the two speakers do first?

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear some questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Twin sisters are supposed to be very much alike, are they not?
Well, my twin sister Jane and I do look alike,
however, we are different in many ways.
We like very different styles of clothing.
I prefer to dress informally, whereas my twin sister dresses like a model,
always wearing the latest fashions.
We have very similar character in most ways.
I do not get angry easily and enjoy being with friends,
and in these respects, my twin sister feels the same.
But she likes loud music and modern dances,
while I find that nightclubs give me a headache.
She is always with friends, is a favorite with all the teachers,
and never wants to have any children,
whereas I prefer to be alone at times,
don't really try to impress my teachers
and intend some day to have a family of my own.
We have tried to live in the same room several times,
and even agreed on the color we like best, and the kind of furniture we want,
but I like to keep things neat and orderly,
while my twin sister acts as if there were a servant around to pick up all the things
that get thrown on the floor.
I like to go to bed early and get up early.
In contrast, she doesn't seem to have any definite habits,
often goes to bed very late, and then sleeps late the next day.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What kind of clothes does the speaker like?
17. What do the twin sisters have in common?
18. Why isn't the speaker likely to live in the same room with her sister?
Passage Two
Until the twentieth century cigarettes were not an important threat to public health.
Since the cigarette industry began in the 1870s,
however, the cigarette-manufacturing machine has developed rapidly.
This made it possible to produce great numbers of cigarettes very quickly,
and it reduced the price.
Today cigarette smoking is a widespread habit.
About forty-three percent of the men and thirty-one percent of the adult women
in the United States smoke cigarettes regularly.
It is encouraging to note,
however, that millions of people have given up the smoking habit.
Income, education and occupation all play a part
in determining a person's smoking habits.
City people smoke more than people living on farms.
Well-educated men with high income are less likely to smoke cigarettes
than men with fewer years of schooling and lower incomes.
On the other hand, if a well-educated man with a high income smokes at all,
he is likely to smoke more packs of cigarettes per day.
The situation is somewhat different for women.
There are slightly more smokers among women
with higher family income and higher education
than among the lower income and lower education groups.
These more highly educated women tend to smoke more heavily.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What reduced the price of cigarettes?
20. What is the percentage of American adult women who smoke regularly?
21. What plays a part in determining a person's smoking habit?
22. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
Passage Three
Life on earth depends on the sun.
Day after day we see its light and feel its warmth,
but we do not often consider their origin.
Yet there are many remarkable things about the sun.
One is its distance from the earth.
This is about 93 million miles.
A journey of this distance, even if it could be made,
would take several hundred years even in the fastest rocket.
The sun makes us feel hot,
even at a distance of 93 million miles.
This is not surprising.
The temperature on the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
But we receive only a small part of the heat.
The total heat of the sun could melt a column of ice
two and a quarter miles thick and 93 million miles high in a second.
The brightness of the sun is equally astonishing.
As we said earlier, we receive only a very small part of the sun's heat.
We also receive only a very small part of its light.
This is sufficient for the growth of trees and plants,
and for the existence of living creatures on the earth.
Too much heat and light would destroy the balance of life.
The heat and light from the sun come in just the right quantities for life on earth.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. What remarkable things are mentioned in the passage?
24. What is the temperature on the sun?
25. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
Fifteen passengers were burned alive
when a passenger bus was set on fire
by unknown men in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province,
an official said.
Naseer Ahmed Nasir, deputy commissioner in the city of Sibi,
said four men on motorcycles initially opened fire
on a parked passenger bus at a hotel.
 "The armed men then came close to the bus and splashed petrol,
setting it on fire," he said.
He said most of the dead were either children or women.
Balochistan, near the Afghan border, is rich in natural resources.
But it is also in under a riot.
Militants there have for years
complained that the central government
has paid little attention to them and their economic needs.
They have been fighting Pakistani military forces for self-rule.
Pakistan has said the militants in Balochistan do not
have links to the Islamic hard-liners
who have launched attacks in other parts of the country.
1. Who were most of the victims according to the news?
2. What are the militants in Balochistan dissatisfied with?
Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
A UN agency says there are major funding gaps
in efforts to help the agricultural sector adapt to climate change.
The Food and Agriculture Organization,
the FAO, says this could affect food security.
The warning comes as the UN Climate Change Conference
continues in Cancun, Mexico.
The World Bank estimates it will cost about $2.5 billion a year
---for the next 40 years---
to help agriculture in developing countries adapt to climate change.
Other estimates say costs could run as high as $14 billion a year.
However, the FAO says,
 "Available financing mechanisms are substantially insufficient
to meet the climate change and food security challenges
faced by the agricultural sector."
This, despite the fact that the FAO says
there are many examples of how agriculture can become more.
3. According to the world bank,
how much does it cost to tackle agricultural challenges yearly?
4. According to FAO,
what is the problem faced by the agricultural sector?
Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced yesterday
it was raising interest rates for the first time since 2006.
Known as the Fed, it's America's central bank.
It's led by Janet Yellen.
Its job is to help stabilize America's financial system.
The Fed makes moves to try to lower
unemployment and control inflation,
when the price of goods goes up too fast for people to afford them.
Because the U.S. economy is growing,
the Fed raised its key interest rate
by a quarter of a percentage point, not much.
But gradual rate increases are likely in the New Year.
That means you'll have to pay more interest
if you borrow money, higher loan rates for home buyers,
higher interest rates if you finance a car,
higher student loan rates for people who enter colleges afterwards.
Eventually, savings accounts could earn a little more interest.
A decade since the last "Star Wars",
and nearly just as long, nine years,
since the Fed last changed interest rates.
But now, it's time for the Fed to awaken,
because after three episodes of quantitative easing,
Janet Yellen must now use her most powerful weapon
to restore balance in the economy.
5. What will happen to interest rates in the US?
6. Why did the Fed change interest rates?
7. Who will benefit from the change of interest rates?
Section B

Conversation One
M: What are you going to have?
W: I have no idea. Could you help me with the menu?
M: Yes, sure. These are starters,
and these are main courses and these are desserts. See?
W: What's the alternative?
M: The alternative is to order a complete dinner.
For a set price you get your choice of soup or juice,
one dish with potato and vegetable, salad, bread and butter
and sometimes coffee and sometimes dessert.
W: And you pay the price listed next to the main course?
M: Right. Like the roast beef dinner is $7.85-plus tax and tip, of course.
W: It all looks pretty expensive to me.
M: It's not. This is only a bit more expensive than McDonald's.
So enjoy yourself. We're celebrating, remember?
Order anything you'd like to try; it's all on me.
W: You're very kind.
M: Friends are friends. I cannot get promoted often.
Are you ready to order?
W: Ah, can you tell me what Hot Fudge Sundae is?
M: That's a dessert. It's an English specialty.
It's a kind of ice cream with a hot sticky sauce over the top
---very sweet and fattening!
W: I don't really like the sound of that.
How come there is English food?
I thought we agreed to eat American food.
M: Our country is made up of people from all over the world,
so besides collected words and phrases from every language,
we've also absorbed recipes.
We even have a lot of Chinese restaurants now.
W: Which is better, French or Chinese cuisine?
M: I'd say it's a toss-up. I love them both.
W: I didn't know you were so fond of foreign foods.
When my boss promotes me,
I will take you to a French restaurant near my company.
The food there is delicious.
M: Oh, we will have a second dinner soon.

That's the main reason why I like to dine here.
M: Oh, I'm sorry,
but we aren't serving pies today.
W: Huh?
M: Well, you see, Dave,
our baker,
slipped on a banana peel back in our kitchen two days ago,
and injured his back.
W: Oh, no.
M: He'll be out for at least two weeks.
In the meantime,

Section C
Directions: In this section, you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.
Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Nowadays motorcycling is fast becoming one of Americans' most popular sports.
However, there are several things about motorcycling
that the average citizen dislikes.
Motorcyclists frequently get dirty.
In fact, they are dirty.
On the road there is little to protect them from mud,
insects and bird droppings.
For practical reasons,
they are often dressed in old clothing,
which looks much less respectable than the clothing of people
who ride in cars.
For the same reason, motorcyclists usually wear dark colors.
Of course, the danger of motorcycling also helps account for
many people's low opinion of the sport.
Its defenders, however, claim that careful cyclists are in less danger
than it's commonly believed.
He must pay careful attention to his driving.
From that point of view, a man on a motorcycle is safer than a man in a car.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. Why do motorcyclists often dress in old and dark clothing?
17. What's the average citizen's opinion about motorcycling?
18. How can a motorcyclist be safer than a car driver?
Passage Two
Speech is one of the most important ways of communicating.
It consists of far more than just making noises.
To talk and also to be understood by other people,
we have to speak a language, that is,
we have to use combinations of sounds
that everyone agrees stand for a particular object or idea.
Communication would be impossible if everyone made up their own language.
Learning a language properly is very important.
The basic vocabulary of English is not very large,
and only about 2,000 words are needed to speak it quite well.
But the more words you know,
the more ideas you can express,
and the more precise you can be about their exact meaning.
Words are the main thing we use in communicating what we want to say.
The way we say the words is also very important.
Our tone of voice can express many emotions and shows
whether we are pleased or angry, for instance.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What are used to stand for a particular object or idea
when we speak a language?
20. What if everyone made up their own language?
21. What is also important besides the main thing in communicating?
Passage Three
Father's Day was first observed in Spokane,
Washington, in 1910.
Mrs. Dodd first proposed the idea of a "father's day" in 1906.
Mrs. Dodd wanted a special day to honor her father, William Smart,
who was widowed when his wife died in childbirth
after their sixth child was born.
Mr. Smart was left to raise the newborn
and his other five children by himself.
Mrs. Dodd wanted Father's Day to be celebrated
on the first Sunday in June,
her father's birthday.
But it wasn't until 1966
that President Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation,
declaring the 3rd Sunday of June as Father's Day.
In 1972,
President Richard Nixon established a permanent national ceremony of Father's Day
to be held on the third Sunday of June,
coming almost sixty years
after Mother's Day had been proclaimed a national holiday.
Today, Father's Day has become a day to not only honor your father,
but all men who act as a father-like figure,
such as stepfathers, uncles, grandfathers, and adult males.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. Who first proposed the idea of a "Father's Day"?
23. When was "Father's Day" established to be a permanent national day?
24. When is "Father's Day" celebrated nowadays?
25. For what purpose do we celebrate "Father's Day" according to the passage?

Part II Listening Comprehension
Section A
Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
At the end of each news report,
you will hear two or three questions.
Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
A new study on climate change
says a disastrous 4-degree rise in global temperature
is increasingly likely to occur within many people's lifetimes.
The studies have been adopted
by one of the world's leading research bodies
monitoring climate change, the Hadley Centre in Britain.
This latest prediction from the Hadley Centre
brings the prospect of destructive change much closer.
He challenges the assumption that severe warming
is a threat only for future generations.
A four degree average temperature rise by the 2050s
would bring increases of 10 degrees or more
in some areas such as the Arctic and Africa.
It could mean a sharp decline in rainfall in some areas,
flooding in others and disappearance of about
half of all the world's animal and plant species.
1. How many temperatures are expected to rise globally by the 2050s?
2. What is the result of the temperature rise by the 2050s?
Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
As many as a million Cubans are said to have attended the free concert
in Havana's revolution square
that featured some of the Latin America's most popular musicians.
Many in the crowd came dress in white to symbolize peace.
The 5-hour event included the bands from seven countries,
it was organized by the Miami base Colombian rock star Wallace.
"This concert is just about peace, is just about possibility to get together,
you know, through music, through art.
And this particular case of Cuba have isolated
from the rest of community for many years,
just because of political belief.
So we just want to come here and saying well,
we are here, we are the same.
So that is the reason why we are here to promote peace."
3. What is the theme of the concert?
4. What can we learn about the concert?
Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
Crude oil is measured in barrels.
Last summer, its global price was $100 per barrel.
Yesterday, it was trading at less than half of that, at about $46.50 a barrel.
Why does that matter?
Well, the price of crude affects everything
from gas prices to car prices, to stock prices.
And it determines the number of jobs in the large global oil industry.
The current surplus of oil gives us a clear lesson
in the economic principle of supply and demand.
When it comes to oil, it used to be all about the Middle East.
Today, the Persian Gulf still has plenty of crude, but the boom is global.
We produced a surplus of 2 million to 3 million barrels per day.
Oil buried deep beneath the earth surface in rock
can now be accessed with new technologies
like fracking and horizontal drilling.
Two years ago, U.S. oil production
saw its biggest jump in more than 100 years,
and it's not the only country to gain a large flood of crude.
Production in Canada and Brazil has also hit record levels.
At the same time, there are more alternatives to oil,
like natural gas and renewables.
When oil supply exceeds demand, prices fall.
5. What happened to oil price?
6. What caused the change of oil price?
7. Why does oil production increase dramatically?
Section B
Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.

Conversation One
M: Good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm Mr. Smith.
I called you a little while ago about the apartment for rent.
W: Oh, right, Mr. Smith. Come in.
Let me show you the place.
The two rooms are upstairs.
Come with me.
M: You have a very nice house.
W: Thanks. Here we are.
Both are simply furnished with a bed,
a desk and a cupboard.
M: This is not bad. How's the hot water?
That's very important.
I'm asking because where I live now
keeps running out of hot water.
I can't tell you how many cold showers I've had to take.
In fact, I had to take one just this morning.
I can't stand taking cold showers any more.
W: Don't worry.
You can shower to your heart's content in here.
M: How much is the rent?
W: Well, how about $250 a month for each room?
That includes water, electricity and gas.
M: Well, that sounds quite reasonable.
Did you say quite a few people are waiting for these two rooms?
W: Right. But you have no children.
I'd like to put you up higher on the list.
M: Well, thank you very much.
I'll consult with my wife and contact you
as soon as we make up our minds.
It's really very nice talking with you.
W: Thank you. I'm glad you like the rooms.

11. Why would the woman like to rent these two rooms to the man?
Conversation Two
W: Where did you go on May Day?
I called you several times.
M: Really? I have my holiday on a seaside resort.
W: Wow, that's terrific. Did you travel alone?
M: No, my wife and son also traveled with me.
Where did you go then?
W: I went nowhere. I spent the whole holiday writing.
I have to finish it before Mother's Day.
But I do plan to travel next month,
that's why I'm calling you.
Could you give me some advice?
M: Oh, how about the seaside?
That's a really good place for a holiday.
W: Sounds good.
M: There are two hotels I can recommend while you are on your trip.
They are both brand new and are usually fully booked.
So you'd better call them in advance.
W: I see... so what are they like?
M: Well, one is called the Hotel Bay View.
It's on the coast.
So, it is very quiet and peaceful without noise or pollution.
And the rooms are of standard size
and they all have a nice little balcony,
where you can overlook the ocean.
W: That's great!
I need to have a tranquil period to relax.
How about the other?
M: The other is a city center hotel.
Of course, there are no views of the sea
and it tends to be a bit noisy and busy.
But it is very convenient for you to go anywhere from the hotel.
W: Er, it's useless for me.
I don't want to go shopping or do anything like that.
What about the price?
M: Well, the Central Hotel is quite a bit more expensive.
W: I know, thanks for your suggestion.
Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Section C
Directions: In this section,you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear some questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
In the eyes of many people,
city life is attractive with all its advantages and convenience,
yet they don't see the other side of the picture.
First, with the expansion of the city,
housing has become a serious problem for city people.
Then there is the problem of pollution.
Harmful gases from vehicles and poisonous water from factories
pollute our surroundings, and noise continually disturbs your peace
and rest and drives you mad.
Thirdly, modern city life puts a high pressure upon people,
you have to hurry to bump into the flood of people,
bicycles, cars, buses... All day long you are under great stress.
Fourthly, big cities also cause some social problems,
of which high crime rate is the most serious one.
People are justifiably in fear of becoming victims of burglaries,
robbery, murder and other crimes at any time.
The city should find some way or other to cope with all these problems.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What may drive city people mad, according to the passage?
17. What are city people constantly in fear of?
18. What is this passage mainly about?
Passage Two
Man has always been fascinated by dreams.
He has always tried to find explanations for his dreams.
Perhaps dreams tell us about the future or the past;
perhaps they tell us about our deepest fears and hopes.
I'll give you one or two facts about dreams.
First of all, everyone dreams. You often hear people say,
"I never dream" when they mean
"I can never remember my dreams."
When we dream, our eyes move rapidly in our sleep
as if we were watching a moving picture,
following it with our eyes. This movement is called REM,
which is Rapid Eye Movement. REM sleep is the sleep that matters.
Experiments have proved
that if we wake people up throughout the night during REM,
they will feel exhausted the next day.
But they won't feel tired at all if we wake them up at times
when they're not dreaming.
So it is clear that it is dreaming that really refreshes us,
not just the sleep.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. Why has man been so fascinated by dreams?
20. What does REM mean?
21. What have the experiments proved about dreams?
Passage Three
Are you familiar with large supermarkets?
If so, then you probably know
that almost everything in the market is in a container.
Most food is in containers.
Even fresh meat is sold in plastic packages.
Fresh fruit and vegetables are usually the only food items
that don't come in containers.
In fact, almost everything at the supermarket is in a bag,
a box, a bottle, a jar, a carton, or a can.
This kind of packaging system is necessary at large supermarkets.
Supermarkets buy large quantities of everything.
Products must be protected during shipment
and they must sit on shelves for long periods of time.
Containers, therefore, protect the products.
Containers have another function, too.
They give information about each product
---names, weights, materials, and ingredients,
and sometimes pictures of the products.
This information is printed on labels or directly on the containers.
But think of this, we never see most of the things
we buy at the supermarket until we get home and open the containers.
When we go shopping, we look at the labels on the containers.
If the container is made of glass or clear plastic,
perhaps we could see a little bit of the product.
But usually containers completely hide their products.
Shoppers must trust the labels.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. Which of the following is usually not sold in containers at large supermarkets?
23. What are the functions of containers?
24. Which of the following doesn't need to be printed on labels?
25. Why must shoppers trust labels?

After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
How do you choose a college?
Some of you might choose a school based on the courses that it offers.
Some might choose one that's close to home, or really far away.
But how about for a money-back guarantee?
Lansing Community College in Michigan
is offering that deal to some students.
If you take certain classes,
and if you don't get a job within one year after you finish,
you can get your money back!
There is some fine print to this.
You can't miss any classes,
you have to do all your assignments,
and you have to prove that you've been looking for a job.
It's an interesting idea,
especially in a state whose unemployment rate is nearly 12 percent.
1. What may be the advantage for Lansing Community College?
2. What is the unemployment rate in Michigan?
Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
Well, we're taking you to Australia next today,
where the state of Queensland in northeast Australia
is struggling through the effects of a powerful hurricane.
If Queensland sounds familiar,
this same region was hit with severe flooding recently.
This time, the disaster is Cyclone Yasi.
Yasi could be one of the worst hurricanes Australia has ever seen.
We want you to look at this video.
You can see what looks like a sign that got blown down,
flying through the street, being ripped apart.
People in Queensland were warned about Yasi a few days ago,
so they had some time to get ready.
But one official said it could be a tough couple days.
3. What are the Australians suffering from?
4. What can we learn about Yasi from the news?
Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
India is home to more than 1.2 billion people
and second only to China's population.
Because of that huge population and the fact
that it's a federal republic like the U.S.
India is often called the world's largest democracy.
India's population is also young.
Its median age is 27 years old.
In the U.S. that age is closer to 37.
It's no wonder why so many Indians
who are close to the voting age of 18
are realizing they have political power.
This is something that country's politicians are noticing, too.
Many young people are first time voters.
Given that India's youth makes up half of its billion plus population,
how India's young vote will determine the country's future.
They are obviously really frustrated
with current political situation in their country.
The only government these youngsters
have really known is the current Congress party Led One,
which is in power for the last ten years.
During that time, prices have risen sharply.
The price of petrol is doubled.
Some young people are going to vote for a different party,
one that will fight inflation
and will take firm action to control inflation
in the difficult global economy.
5. What is the median age in India?
6. What can we learn about the young people in India?
7. What is the current largest economic problem in India?
Section B
Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.

After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
W: Good evening, and welcome to this week's business world,
the program for and about business people.
Tonight we have Mr. Steven Kayne,
who has just taken over an established bicycle shop.
Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?
M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them.
When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company,
I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby.
I knew then that as soon as I had enough money
to get my own business going, I'll do it.
I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way.
When I went down to the bank and got a business loan,
I knew I'd love being my own boss.
Now my time is my own.
I open the store when I want and leave when I want.
W: You mean you don't keep regular hours?
M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six,
but if business is slower than usual,
I can just lock up and take off early.
W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?
M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do.
They help me out a few days a week.
It's great because we play cards
or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.
W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.
We wish you success in your new business.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
8.What is the woman doing?
9. What did Mr. Kayne do before he took over the bicycle shop?
10. Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?
11. What do we learn about the people working in the shop?
Conversation Two
W: Well, the main activities in the region were historically steel
and paper processing, I think.
M: Yes, but I'm not quite sure about the status of those industries now.
Could you tell us something about that?
W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant,
but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for 44% of industrial activity.
So it's still very important.
In fact, 80% of Spain's machine tools are from the Basque Country.
As for paper processing, there's still a little.
But it's no longer what it once was in the region.
So, is that clear?
M: Yes, thanks.
W: Now, to get back to what I was saying,
there's a lot of unemployment
as well as geographical problems in the region.
M: Sorry, Victoria. What do you mean by geographical problems?
W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts.
So there used to be transport problems,
now though there are new train links and better roads,
but it may be
that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected,
is that OK? Does that make sense?
When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory,
we'll see this in more detail,
so we'll come back to this question, OK?
M: OK, right.
W: So I was about to say something about the work force in the region
and the level of training and education.
In general, it's very good and improving.
Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
12. What was one of the main industrial activities in the region?
13. What does the woman say about steel-related manufacturing in the region?
14. What problem hinders the region's development?
15. What will the speakers discuss later?

with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
I first met Joe Gumps when we were both 9 years old,
which is probably the only reason he is one of my best friends.
If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school,
we wouldn't even have had the chance to get to know each other.
Joe is a day student,
but I am a boarding student.
We haven't been in the same classes,
sports or extracurricular activities.
Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house,
and we talk on the phone every night.
This is not to say that we would not have been compatible
if we had first met in our freshman year.
Rather, we would not have been likely
to spend enough time getting to know each other,
due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests.
In fact, to be honest,
I struggle even now to think of things we have in common,
but maybe that's what makes us enjoy each other's company so much.
When I look at my friendship with Joe,
I wonder how many people I've known whom I never disliked
but simply didn't take the time to get to know.
Thanks to Joe,
I have realized how little basis there is,
for the social divisions that exist in every community.
Since this realization,
I have begun to make an even more determined effort
to find friends in unexpected people and places.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. Why does the speaker say Joe Gumps became one of his best friends?
17. Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?
18. What has the speaker learned from his friendship with Joe?
Passage Two
It was a bad night for Louis.
His research in the neighboring town had taken longer
than he expected.
It was late and he was very tired when he drove home.
He turned into his building's parking lot,
but all the spaces were full.
He drove back out onto the street looking for a parking space.
The first block was full.
The next block was almost empty.
Louis didn't see a no-parking sign,
but he suspected that if parking were allowed there,
most of the spaces would be filled.
Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces.
He was so glad to see them
that he didn't even think to read the sign by the entrance.
He drove in, parked, and hurried home to go to bed.
The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car.
It was gone.
He ran home and telephoned the city police to say
that his car had been stolen.
It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened.
His car had been on a private lot.
It had been taken away by the police.
Louis had to take a taxi to the city garage
far from the center of town.
He had to pay a fee of 40 dollar to get his car back.
In addition, he got a parking ticket
--- his first one ever in Greenville.
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. Where did Louis intend to park his car
when he came back from work one night?
20. What did Louis think had happened to his car the next morning?
21. Where did Louis finally get his car back?
Passage Three
Well, to pick up where we left off last time,
I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea.
It's one of those things we all recognize when we see it.
But we don't really understand what it is.
We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative,
but we don't know how they got that way.
Is creativity a natural gift like good looks?
Or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge?
Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully,
we might get some insight into what it is
and how it might work in our lives.
The creative process has always been accepted
as the source of all important work in the arts.
But we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts.
Every major scientific discovery
began with someone imagining the world to look differently
from the way others saw it.
And this is what the creativity is all about:
imagining the world in a new way.
And despite what you may believe
about the limits of your own creative imaginations,
we all have the potential to imagine the world
in an absolutely new way.
In fact, you were born with it.
It is your birth right as a human being.
And what's more,
you use it every day,
almost every moment of your life.
Your creative imagination
is what you use to make sense of your experiences.
It's your creative mind that gets meaning
from the chaos of your experiences and brings order to your world.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?
23. What is a widely accepted idea about the creative process?
24. What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?
25. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?
This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

Part II Listening Comprehension
Section A
Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
At the end of each news report,
you will hear two or three questions.
Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
Research into the icecap of North Pole
has found that it is melting so quickly
that the Arctic Ocean could lose most of its ice
during summer time in as little as ten years.
Scientists of Cambridge University
say recent exploration to the Arctic led by explorer Pen Hadow
found ice was much thinner than expected and less dense,
subject to rapid melting.
Mr. Hadow said the finding should act as a wake-up call.
The long-term view for the global community,
this is definitely not good news.
But if we can see this for what it is which is the biggest visual cue
that we are going to get to manage our relationship
with the planet better, then that is a good thing.
1. What is this news item mainly about?
2. How can the bad news become a good one?
Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
Fifty-seven "militiamen",
including several high-ranking officers
loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang, were killed
when Tang's forces attacked the Sudan People's Liberation Army
in Southern Sudan, officials said Sunday.
Tang's forces launched the attack at Kaldak on Saturday,
the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
said in a statement issued
on behalf of General Malaak Ayuen of the South Sudan Army.
The SPLA is the military wing of the movement
that governs Southern Sudan.
The SPLA killed 57 of Tang's forces,
including three major generals, according to the statement.
In addition, one major general was captured, the statement said.
Tang himself "narrowly escaped" the fighting,
according to the statement.
Officials said it was unclear why Tang's forces attacked the troops,
but the SPLA said it believes
he has been in contact with other rebel groups in the region.
3. How many major generals were killed in the attack?
4. How was Gabriel Tang after the attack?
Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
Thousands will gather in the city center
just after 5:00 am on Tuesday, April 18,
to remember victims of the Great Earthquake.
Organizers say they will also celebrate the heroism of the survivors.
One hundred years ago, the first small shock
struck at 5:12 in the morning,
and the region shook violently for one minute.
A center of culture and commerce,
San Francisco was then known as the Paris of the West.
Just hours earlier, Italian tenor Enrico Caruso
had appeared in the opera Carmen at the city's opera house.
The singer later recalled trembling with fear
as he looked out of the window of his room at the Palace Hotel.
He saw buildings collapse,
and heard the screams of men, women and children.
Historian Eileen Keremitsis is a volunteer guide
who describes the tragic story for visitors.
The quake was massive
and it was centered just off the coast close to the city.
The shaking damaged or destroyed
thousands of buildings over a wide area,
but Keremitsis says most of the severe destruction
was caused by fires that burned uncontrolled for three days.
5. What does the news item mainly report?
6. What can we learn about the Great Earthquake?
7. According to Keremitsis, what caused the most of the destruction?
Section B
Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.
At the end of each conversation, you will hear four questions.
Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Conversation One
W: So John, I hear you and Arthur share a job, don't you?
M: Yeah.
We've shared a sales job at Sonatech for about two years now.
W: Well, how do you divide up your schedule?
M: You know, we are both sales representatives,
and we take orders over the phone.
When we started job sharing it was difficult,
because we both worked all day Monday.
I worked Tuesday and Thursday
and Arthur worked Wednesday and Friday.
The problem was that when I was in the office on Tuesday.
I would talk to people,
then they would call back on Wednesday with a question.
But Arthur couldn't answer the question
and he couldn't ask me about it
because I wasn't in the office.
So he had to ask the people to call me back the next day, Thursday.
Of course, they didn't like to wait until the next day
to have their question answered.
W: Yes, that sounds like a problem.
M: So, finally we decided that Arthur would work in the mornings
and I would work in the afternoons.
Now if someone calls with a question for me in the morning,
Arthur tells them to call me in the afternoon.
This way, people get their questions answered the same day.
W: What do you do about vacations?
M: Well, Sonatech gives the usual two weeks of vacation
to full-time employees,
I take a week and Arthur takes a week.
W: It sounds like job sharing has worked out well for you.
M: Yes, it has. We are both happy with it.
Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
8. What do John and Arthur do at Sonatech?
9. What problem did John and Arthur have when they started job sharing?
10. What is Arthur's final solution when someone calls with a question for John?

Conversation Two
W: May I see your license, please?
M: But officer, did I do something wrong?
W: Do you mean to say you didn't see the speed limit sign back there?
M: Um, no, ma'am , I guess I didn't.
W: In other words, you drove by too fast to read it.
The sign says 35m/h. A school is just nearby, you know?
M: Don't get me wrong,
but my speedometer didn't read much faster than that.
W: Then, why is it that my radar showed you were going 45?
Let me put it another way.
I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
Again, may I see your license, please?
M: Here it is, officer. But let me explain.
I was late for an important appointment
and I was worried that I wouldn't make it on time. So...
W: Um ha, just a minute, here.
Your license is no longer valid.
You should have renewed it two weeks ago.
I'm going to have to write you up for that, too.
M: What? Really?
W: Your license becomes invalid on your birthday
and that was two weeks ago according to the date here.
You are in violation of the law---driving without a valid license.
M: I'm sorry, ma'am. I hadn't realized that.
W: Here's the ticket for not having a valid license.
But I'm only going to give you a warning
about exceeding the speed limit.
Be careful next time.
M: Yes, ma'am, officer, I will. Thank you.

Section C
Directions: In this section, you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.
Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer from the four choices
marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Since I started working part-time at a grocery store,
I have learned that a customer is more than someone
who buys something.
To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely
once he or she starts to push a shopping card.
One of the first things customers forget is how to count.
There's no other way to explain
how so many people get in their express line,
which is clearly marked 15 items or less,
with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items.
Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place.
Just as I finish ringing up an order,
a customer will say,
"Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread.
I hope you don't mind waiting while I go get it. "
Five minutes later,
he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk,
and three rolls of paper towels.
Strange is it seems customers also seem to forget
that they have to pay for their groceries.
Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card
while I am ringing up the groceries,
my customer will wait until I announce the total.
Then, in surprise, she says,
"Oh no, what did I do with my check book?"
After 5 minutes of digging through her purse,
she borrows my pen because she's forgotten hers.
But I have to be tolerant of customers
because they pay my salary,
and that's something I can't afford to forget.
Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What does the speaker say about customers' entering the grocery store?
17. Which customers are supposed to be in the express line?
18. What does the speaker say some customers do
when they arrive at the check-out counter?
19. What does the speaker say about his job at the end of the talk?
Passage Two
The speech delivery style of Europeans and Asians tends to be very formal.
Speakers of these cultures often read oral presentations
from carefully written manuscripts.
On the other hand,
American speakers are generally more informal
relative to speakers in other cultures.
American audiences prefer natural, spontaneous delivery
that conveys a lively sense of communication.
They don't relate well to speakers who read from a manuscript.
If you use an outline of your ideas instead of a prepared text,
your speech will not only sound more natural,
but you will also be able to establish better relationship
with your listeners and keep their attention.
The language and style you use when making an oral presentation
should not be the same as the language in style you use when writing.
Well-written information,
that is meant to be read,
does not work as well when it is heard.
It is, therefore,
important for you to adapt written texts
or outlines for presentations.
Good speakers are much more informal
when speaking than when writing.
They also use their own words
and develop their own speaking styles.
Whenever possible, they use short words.
Listeners are appreciated when speakers use simple,
everyday words in a presentation.
One advantage is that it is much easier
for speakers to pronounce short words correctly.
Another is that long and sophisticated vocabulary choices
make listening more difficult.
Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
20. What does the speaker say American audiences prefer?
21. What should one pay attention to when making an oral presentation?
22.What does the speaker focus on in the talk?
Passage Three
Let children learn to judge their own work
A child learning to talk
does not learn by being corrected all the time.
If corrected too much, he will stop talking.
He compares a thousand times a day
the difference between language as he uses it
and language as those around him use it.
Bit by bit, he makes the necessary changes
to make his language like other people's.
In the same way,
kids learning to do all the other things
they learn without adult teachers,
to walk, run, climb, ride a bike, play games,
compare their own performance
with what more skilled people do,
and slowly make the needed changes.
But in school we never give a child a chance to detect his mistakes.
We do it all for him.
We act as if we thought he would never notice a mistake
unless it was pointed out to him.
Soon he becomes dependent on the expert.
We should let him do it himself.
Let him figure out,
with the help of other children if he wants it,
what this word says,
what is the answer to that problem,
whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or that.
If right answers need to be given,
as in mathematics or science,
give him the answer book.
Let him correct his own papers.
Why should we teachers waste time on such tedious work?
Our job should be to help children
when they tell us that they can't find a way to get the right answer.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. How does a child learn to do something according to the speaker?
24. What belief do teachers commonly hold according to the speaker?
25. What does the speaker imply about the current way of teaching?
This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

News Report One
A Danish politician who tried to post a photo of
Copenhagen's famous Little Mermaid statue on Facebook
was told it could not be published because of posting rules.
Social Democrat MP Mette Gjerskov
wanted to post a link to her blog,
which included a shot of the bronze statue,
when she received a rejection notification from the site.
The message,
which Ms. Gjerskov shared on her social media accounts,
said the Little Mermaid image contained
"too much bare skin or sexual implication".
It added that the rules applied
even if an image had "artistic or educational purposes".
Ms. Gjerskov described the decision as "totally ridiculous",
although in a later update she said
Facebook had subsequently given in and approved the image.
In March this year,
the site clarified its rules on naked photos and said that
it does allow photos of paintings, sculptures and other art
that depicts naked figures.
Question 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
1. Where is the statue located?
2. What do we learn about Facebook's current posting rules?
News Report Two
In some countries the idea of paternity leave---
when a father takes time off work to stay at home
with a new child---has yet to take hold.
In Sweden, which has been encouraging fathers
to take paternity leave since 1974.
In 1974, the country was the first in the world
to replace maternity leave with parental leave,
giving both partners the chance of time at home with their children.
Today, Swedish couples get around 16 months (480 days)
paid parental leave when their child is born.
For the first 390 days,
the parent who is off work gets paid 80% of their salary
by the state up to around 111 US dollars a day.
Sweden is rated as having one of the world's narrowest gender gaps
according to the World Economic Forum.

News Report Three
Apple stock is back to a place it hasn't been in a long time:
it costs less than $100 a share.
So is it a bargain buy or just the beginning of a lower price?
Expert opinions are all over the place.
Wall street analysts---
the people who get paid to predict where stock prices are headed---
have forecasts for the stock ranging from 65 US dollars to 200 US dollars.
The overwhelmingly majority of experts still say Apple is a "strong buy."
The average forecast is for the stock to hit $142 in the coming months,
according to data compiled by TipRanks,
a site that tracks and ranks analysts on their predictions.
Where the stock is going depends on iPhone sales
and its ability to innovate more.
Apple shares are tanking this week
because of a report in Japan's Nikkei newspaper
that Apple plans to reduce output of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus by 30%.
That comes on the heels of an Accenture report warning that
demand for smartphones is decreasing.
People don't believe the newer models are all that
much better than what they currently have,
so they don't want to pay for an upgrade.
Question 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
5. What change took place in Apple recently?
6. What helped bring about the change according to an Accenture report?
7. What can we learn about Apple's smartphones?

Conversation One
W: Please have a seat, Mr. Saunders.
I received your resume last week, and was very impressed.
M: Thank you!
W: We are a small financial company trading mostly stocks and bonds.
May I ask why you are interested in working for us?
M: Your company has an impressive reputation
and I've always wanted to work for a smaller company.
W: That's good to hear.
Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job?
M: I'm currently working in a large international company
in charge of a team of 8 brokers.
We buy and sell stocks for major clients worldwide.
W: Why do you think you are the right candidate for this position?
M: As a head broker, I have a lot of experience in the stock market.
I deal with clients on a daily basis, and I enjoy working with people.
W: Well, you might just be the person we've been looking for.
Do you have any questions?
M: Uh-hum.
If I were hired, how many accounts would I be handling?
W: You will be working with two other head brokers.
In other words, you will be handling about a third of our clients.
M: And who would I report to?
W: Directly to me.
M: I see.
What kind of benefits package do you offer?
W: Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year employment.
You'll also be entitled to medical and dental insurance,
but this is something you should discuss with our Personnel Department.
Do you have any other questions?
M: No, not at the moment.
W: Well, I'll have to discuss your application with my colleagues
and we'll get back to you early next week.

Conversation Two
M: Hey, Karen, you are not really reading it, are you?
W: Pardon?
M: The book！You haven't turned the page in the last ten minutes.
W: No, Jim, I suppose I haven't.
I need to get through it though, but I keep drifting away.
M: So it doesn't really hold your interest?
W: No, not really.
I wouldn't bother with it, to be honest,
but I have to read it for a seminar. I'm at a university.
M: It's a labor of labor then rather than a labor of love.
W: I should say. I don't like Dickens at all really, the author.
Indeed, I am starting to like the whole course less and less.
M: It's not just the book.
It's the course as well?
W: Yeah, in a way, although the course itself isn't really that bad,
a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturers are fine.
It's me, I suppose.
You see, I wanted to do philosophy rather than English,
but my parents talked me out of it.
M: So the courses are OK as such.
It's just that had it been left to you,
you would have chosen a different one.
W: Oh, they had my best interests at heart, of course, my parents.
They always do, don't they?
They believe that my job prospects would've been pretty limited
with the degree of philosophy.
Plus, they give me a really generous allowance,
but I am beginning to feel that I'm wasting my time and their money.
They would be so disappointed, though, if I told them I was quitting.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
In Greece, only rich people will rest in peace forever when they die.
Most of the population, however,
will be undisturbed for only three years.
Then they will be dug up, washed, compressed into a small tin box,
and placed in a bone room.
If the body has only partially decayed,
it is reburied in a smaller, cheaper grave, but not for long.
The body will be dug up again sometime later
when it has fully decayed.
Buying a piece of land for a grave is the only way to avoid this process.
The cost of the grave is so great
that most people choose to rent a grave for three years
and even after being dug up, lasting peace is still not guaranteed.
If no one pays for renting space in the bone room,
the skeleton is removed and stored in a building
in a poor part of the town.
Lack of space in Athens is the main reason
why the dead are dug up after three years.
The city is so overcrowded that
sometimes dead bodies are kept in hospitals for over a week
until a grave is found.
Athens' city council wants to introduce cremation,
that is, burning dead bodies as a means of dealing with the problem.
But the Greek church resists this practice.
They believe the only place where people burn is hell,
so burning dead bodies is against the Greek concept of life after death.
To save space,
the church suggested burying the bodies standing up instead of lying down.
Some people proposed building multi-storey underground graveyards.
Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What must Greeks do to keep the dead resting in everlasting peace?
17. Why are most dead bodies in Athens dug up after three years?
18. What suggestions does the church give about the burying of dead bodies?
19. What practice does the Greek church object to?
Passage Two
If you visit a big city anywhere in the world,
you will probably find a restaurant
which serves the food of your native country.
Most large cities in the United States
offer an international sample of foods.
Many people enjoy eating the food of other nations.
This is probably one reason
why there are so many different kinds of restaurants in the United States.
A second reason is that many Americans come from other parts of the world.
They enjoy tasting the foods of their native lands.
In the city of Detroit, for example,
there are many people from Western Europe, Greece,
Latin America, and the Far East.
There are many restaurants in Detroit
which serve the foods of these areas.
There are many other international restaurants too.
Americans enjoy the foods in these restaurants
as well as the opportunity to better understand the people
and their way of life.
One of the most common international restaurants
to be found in the United States is the Italian restaurant.
The restaurant may be a small business run by a single family.
The mother of the family cooks all of the dishes,
and the father and children serve the people who come to eat there.
Or it may be a large restaurant owned by several different people
who work together in the business.
Many Italian dishes that Americans enjoy
are made with meats, tomatoes and cheese.
They are very delicious and tasty.
Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
20. Why are there so many international restaurants in the United States?
21. Why do Americans like to go to international restaurants
apart from enjoying the foods there?
22. How is the typical Italian family restaurant run in the United States?
Passage Three
One winter day in 1891,
a class at a training school in Massachusetts, USA,
went into the gym for their daily exercises.
Since the football season had ended,
most of the young men felt they were in for a boring time.
But their teacher, James Naismith, had other ideas.
He had been working for a long time on the new game
that would have the excitement of American football.
Naismith showed the men a basket he had hung at each end of the gym,
and explained that they were going to use a round European football.
At first everybody tried to throw the ball into the basket
no matter where he was standing.
"Pass! Pass!" Naismith kept shouting,
blowing his whistle to stop the excited players.
Slowly, they began to understand what was wanted of them.
The problem with the new game,
which was soon called "basketball",
was getting the ball out of the basket.
They used ordinary food baskets with bottoms,
and the ball, of course, stayed inside.
At first, someone had to climb up every time a basket was scored.
It was several years before someone came up with the idea
of removing the bottom of the basket and letting the ball fall through.
There have been many changes in the rules since then,
and basketball has become one of the world's most popular sports.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. What did Naismith do to entertain his students one winter day?
24. According to the speaker, what was the problem with the new game?
25. How was the problem with the new game solved?
this is the end of listening comprehension.

The US military says joint air strikes in Syria and Iraq
have killed two Islamic State commanders
linked to the attacks in Paris in November,
as well as eight other senior IS figures.
Laura Bicker reports from Washington.
The operation to degrade and destroy the Islamic group
involves hunting down and killing its leaders.
Among them were Charaffe al Mouadan.
He's thought to have been close friends
of the leader of the attacks in Paris.
Another of those killed was Abdel Kader Hakim,
a veteran fighter with specialism in forgery.
He's reported to have links to the IS network in the French capital.
An airstrike also killed a UK educated Bangladeshi
computer system engineer called Siful Haque Sujan.
He's said to have supported IS hacking efforts,
their anti-surveillance technology and their weapons development.

News Report Two
At a vast dumpsite in the west of Ghana's capital Accra,
small fires burn among piles of old computers,
television screens and laptops,
throwing clouds of thick black smoke into the air.
Around them workers pick out motherboards,
valuable metals and copper wires,
burning away the plastic coverings as they go---
filling the air with poisonous fumes.
For many it's a profitable business in a country
where nearly a quarter of people live below the poverty line.
"It's an instant job," said Sam Sandu,
a scrap dealer who works on the site.
"Today you work on it, and you can get your money the same day."
But experts warn the poisons present in the waste
are slowly harming the workers,

Three years ago,
after 20 children and 6 adults were shot dead at a school in Connecticut,
President Obama said he would do all in his power
to prevent similar mass shootings in the future by tightening gun control.
Mr. Obama is trying again,
this time bypassing political opposition by using his executive powers.
He set out his plans in an emotional speech at the White House
surrounded by family members of people killed in some of the tragedies
that have taken place during his presidency.
The President emphasized he respected The Second Amendment rights
to bear arms but he said he was determined to act.
He said: "from every family who never imagined
that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.
Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad.
And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.
So all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough
to stand up to the gun lobby's lies.
All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens.
All of us need to demand governors and legislatures
and businesses do their part to make our communities safer."

Conversation One
W: Hey, Bob, guess what? I'm going to visit Quebec next summer.
I'm invited to go to a friend's wedding.
But while I'm there I'd also like to do some sightseeing.
M: That's nice, Sherry.
But do you mean the province of Quebec, or Quebec City?
W: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal.
So I'm going there first.
I'll stay for five days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?
M: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city.
But it's not the capital. Quebec City is.
But Montreal is great.
The Saint Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city.
It's beautiful in summer.
W: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English?
My French is OK, but not that good.
I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?
M: Well, people speak both French and English there.
But you'll hear French most of the time.
And all the street signs are in French.
In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world.
So you'd better practice your French before you go.
W: Good advice. What about Quebec City?
I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?
M: It's a beautiful city, very old.
Many old buildings have been nicely restored.
Some of them were built in the 17th and 18th centuries.
You'll love it there.

Conversation Two
M: Hi, Miss Rowling, how old were you when you started to write?
And what was your first book?
W: I wrote my first finished story when I was about six.
It was about a small animal, a rabbit, I mean.
And I've been writing ever since.
M: Why did you choose to be an author?
W: If someone asked me how to achieve happiness,
step one would be finding out what you love doing most
and step two would be finding someone to pay you to do it.
I consider myself very lucky indeed to be able to support myself by writing.
M: Do you have any plans to write books for adults?
W: My first two novels were for adults.
I suppose I might write another one.
But I never really imagine a target audience when I'm writing.
The ideas come first.
So it really depends on the idea that grabs me next.
M: Where did the ideas for the Harry Potter books come from?
W: I've no idea where the ideas came from.
And I hope I'll never find out.
It would spoil my excitement if it turned out
I just have a funny little wrinkle on the surface of my brain,
which makes me think about invisible train platforms.
M: How do you come up with the names of your characters?
W: I invented some of them, but I also collect strange names.
I've gotten them from ancient saints, maps, dictionaries,
plants, war memorials and people I've met.
M: Oh, you are really resourceful.

Passage One
Reducing the amount of sleep students get at night
has a direct impact on their performance at school during the day.
According to classroom teachers,
elementary and middle school students who stay up late
exhibit more learning and attention problems.
This has been shown by Brown Medical School
and Bradley Hospital research.
In the study,
teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received
when completing weekly performance reports,
yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less
as having the most trouble recalling old material,
learning new lessons and completing high-quality work.
Teachers also reported that
these students had more difficulty paying attention.
The experiment is the first
to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children.
Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty
and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well-functioning kids,
said Garharn Forlone, the study's lead author.
So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message:
when a child is having learning and attention problems,
the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration.
"If we don't ask about sleep,
and try to improve sleep patterns in kids' struggling academically,
then we aren't doing our job," Forlone said.
For parents, he said, the message is simple,
"getting kids to bed on time
is as important as getting them to school on time."
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What were teachers told to do in the experiment?
17. According to the experiment,
what problem can insufficient sleep cause in students?
18. What message did the researcher intend to convey to parents?
Passage Two
Patricia Pania never wanted to be a national public figure.
All she wanted to be was a mother and homemaker.
But her life was turned upside down when a motorist,
distracted by his cell phone,
ran a stop sign and crashed into the side of her car.
The impact killed her 2-year-old daughter.
Four months later,
Pania reluctantly but courageously decided to try to educate the public
and to fight for laws to ban drivers from using cell phones
while a car is moving.
She wanted to save other children from what happened to her daughter.
In her first speech, Pania got off to a shaky start.
She was visibly trembling and her voice was soft and uncertain.
But as she got into her speech, a dramatic transformation took place.
She stopped shaking and spoke with a strong voice.
For the rest of her talk, she was a forceful and compelling speaker.
She wanted everyone in the audience to know what she knew
without having to learn it from a personal tragedy.
Many in the audience were moved to tears and to action.
In subsequent presentations,
Pania gained reputation as a highly effective speaker.
Her appearance on a talk show was broadcast three times,
transmitting her message to over 14 million people.
Her campaign increased public awareness of the problem,
and prompted over 300 cities and several states
to consider restrictions on cell phone use.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What was the significant change in Patricia Pania's life?
20. What had led to Pania's personal tragedy?
21. How did Pania feel when she began her first speech?
22. What could be expected as a result of Pania's efforts?
Passage Three
Many people catch a cold in the spring time or fall.
It makes us wonder: if scientists can send a man to the moon,
why can't they find a cure for the common cold? The answer is easy.
There're actually hundreds of kinds of cold viruses out there.
You never know which one you will get,
so there isn't a cure for each one.
When a virus attacks your body,
your body works hard to get rid of it.
Blood rushes to your nose and causes a blockage in it.
You feel terrible because you can't breathe well,
but your body is actually eating the virus.
Your temperature rises and you get a fever,
but the heat of your body is killing the virus.
You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting into your cells.
You may feel miserable,
but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold.
Different people have different remedies for colds.
In the United States and some other countries,
for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better.
Some people take hot bath and drink warm liquids.
Other people take medicines to relieve various symptoms of colds.
There is one interesting thing to note.
Some scientists say taking medicines
when you have a cold is actually bad for you.
The virus stays in you longer,
because your body doesn't develop a way to fight it and kill it.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. According to the passage,
why haven't scientists found a cure for the common cold?
24. What does the speaker say about the symptoms of the common cold?
25. What do some scientists say about taking medicines for the common cold,
according to the passage?

Passage One
My mother was born in a small town in northern Italy.
She was three when her parents immigrated to America in 1926.
They lived in Chicago when my grandfather worked making ice cream.
Mama thrived in the urban environment.
At 16, she graduated first in her high school class,
went onto secretarial school,
and finally worked as an executive secretary for a railroad company.
She was beautiful too.
When a local photographer used her pictures
in his monthly window display,
she felt pleased.
Her favorite portrait showed her sitting by Lake Michigan,
her hair went blown, her gaze reaching toward the horizon.
My parents were married in 1944.
Dad was a quiet and intelligent man.
He was 17 when he left Italy.
Soon after, a hit-and-run accident left him with a permanent limp.
Dad worked hard selling candy to Chicago office workers on their break.
He had little formal schooling.
His English was self-taught.
Yet he eventually built a small successful wholesale candy business.
Dad was generous and handsome.
Mama was devoted to him.
After she married, my mother quit her job and gave herself to her family.
In 1950, with three small children,
dad moved the family to a farm 40 miles from Chicago.
He worked the land and commuted to the city to run his business.
Mama said good-bye to her parents and friends,
and traded her busy city neighborhood for a more isolated life.
But she never complained.

16. What does the speaker tell us about his mother's early childhood?
17. What do we learn about the speaker's father?

Passage Two
During a 1995 roof collapse,
a firefighter named Donald Herbert was left brain damaged.
For ten years, he was unable to speak.
Then, one Saturday morning,
he did something that shocked his family and doctors.
He started speaking.
"I want to talk to my wife." Donald Herbert said out of the blue.
Staff members of the nursing home
where he had lived for more than seven years raced
to get Linda Herbert on the telephone.
"It was the first of many conversations the 44-year-old patient
had with his family and friends during the 14-hour stretch",
Herbert's uncle Simon Menka said.
"How long have I been away?" Herbert asked.
"We told him almost ten years," the uncle said,
"he thought it was only three months."
Herbert was fighting a house fire December 29, 1995,
when the roof collapsed, burying him underneath.
After going without air for several minutes,
Herbert was unconscious for two and a half months
and has undergone therapy ever since.
News accounts in the days and years after his injury
described Herbert as blind and with little if any memory.
A video shows him receiving physical therapy
but apparently unable to communicate
and with little awareness of his surroundings.
Menka declined to discuss his nephew's current condition
or whether the apparent progress was continuing.
"The family was seeking privacy
while doctors evaluated Herbert," he said.
As word of Herbert's progress spread,
visitors streamed into the nursing home.
"He's resting comfortably," the uncle told them.
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. What happened to Herbert ten years ago?
20. What surprised Donald Herbert's family and doctors one Saturday?
21. How long did Herbert remain unconscious?
22. How did Herbert's family react to the public attention?
Passage Three
Almost all states in America have a state fair.
They last for one, two or three weeks.
The Indiana State Fair is one of the largest and oldest state fairs
in the United States.
It is held every summer.
It started in 1852.
Its goals were to educate, share ideas,
and present Indiana's best products.
The cost of a single ticket to enter the fair was 20 cents.
During the early 1930's,
officials of the fair ruled that
the people could attend by paying with something other than money.
For example, farmers brought a bag of grain in exchange for a ticket.
With the passage of time, the fair has grown and changed a lot,
but it is still one of Indiana's most celebrated events.
People from all over Indiana and from many other states attend the fair.
They can do many things at the fair.
They can watch the judging of the price: cows, pigs, and other animals;
they can see sheep getting their wool cut,
and they can learn how that wool is made into clothing;
they can watch cows giving birth.
In fact, people can learn about animals
they would never see except at a fair.
The fair provides a chance for the farming community
to show its skills and farm products.
For example, visitors might see the world's largest apple,
or the tallest sunflower plant.
Today, children and adults at the fair can play new computer games,
or attend more traditional games of skill.
They can watch performances put on by famous entertainers.
Experts say such fairs are important,
because people need to remember that
they're connected to the earth and its products,
and they depend on animals for many things.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. What were the main goals of the Indiana's state fair when it started?
24. How did some farmers gain entrance to the fair in the early 1930's?
25. Why are state fairs important events in America?

New Report One
Google has banned an extension plug-in of its Chrome browser
which was being used to identify Jewish names on the internet
by surrounding them with three sets of brackets, or parentheses.
Those identified were then subjected to anti-semitic abuse via social media.
The symbol has been described as a secret signal
because punctuation does not show up in ordinary web searches.
Google said that the extension was blocked from its store
because it broke its hate speech rules.
The tech giant declined to comment further.
It was called the "coincidence detector"---
a reference to a conspiracy theory about Jewish people and global control.
The extension was developed by a far-right group called alt-right.
It had around 2,500 users and a database of 8,800 common Jewish names
which it could pick out on websites reported tech site Mic.

International investigators have published a photo
of a large Buk missile component
found at the MH17 airliner crash site eastern Ukraine.
The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) image shows a "Venturi",
which emits propellant gases, like a car exhaust.
Dutch prosecutors want more information from Russia about the Buk,
which they say killed 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.
The West and Ukraine say Russian-backed rebels fired the Buk missile.
Russia argues that Ukrainian forces downed MH17.
The Boeing 777, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur,
crashed in rebel-held territory.
The JIT interim report explains the progress of the criminal inquiry.
The experts are studying a mass of tiny fragments
retrieved from the crash site.
Last year, a Dutch Safety Board report concluded that
MH17 was downed by a Russian-made Buk, but did not say who fired it.
Board president Djibbe Joustra said at the time

Europe has some of the toughest gun control laws in the world
and they're about to get even tighter.
As President Obama bypasses Congress
to expand necessary background checks for some private gun sales,
European leaders are reviewing new restrictions on firearms,
and should give their approval next month.
If that happens, the changes would come into effect in July.
The European Union has been debating tougher laws
for years with little progress.
But the terror attacks in Paris in January and November
gave new urgency to the discussion.
EU leaders said in December they would "rapidly examine" the proposals,
with the aim of approving them in February.
Europe already bans all automatic weapons,
plus some semi-automatic guns widely available in the United States.
But European officials say gun laws passed in 2008 are inadequate,
and leave Europe "vulnerable to criminal activity" and terrorist attacks.
Here's what will change if the new law is adopted:
1.More categories of semi-automatic weapons
will be subject to an absolute ban.
2. It will be impossible for deactivated weapons,
currently treated as pieces of metal,
to be traded freely across European borders.
3. Gun brokers and dealers will have to be licensed to deal in weapons.
Question 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.

W: Oh, I'm fed up with my job.
M: Hey, there is a perfect job for you in the paper today.
You might be interested.
W: Oh? What is it? What do they want?
M: Wait a minute. Eh, here it is.
The European Space Agency is recruiting translators.
W: The European Space Agency?
M: Well, that's what it says.
They need an English translator to work from French or German.
W: So they need a degree in French or German, I suppose.
Well, I've got that. What's more, I have plenty of experience.
What else are they asking for?
M: Just that. A university degree and three or four years of experience
as a translator in a professional environment.
They also say the person should have a lively and inquiring mind,
effective communication skills and the ability to work individually
or as a part of the team.
W: Well, if I stay at my present job much longer,
I won't have any mind or skills left.
By the way, what about salary?
I just hope it isn't lower than what I get now.

Section C
Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.
Both the passage and the questions
will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer

Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
When couples get married, they usually plan to have children.
Sometimes however, a couple cannot have a child of their own.
In this case, they may decide to adopt a child.
In fact, adoption is very common today.
There are about 60,000 adoptions each year in the United States alone.
Some people prefer to adopt infants.
Others adopt older children.
Some couples adopt children from their own countries.
Others adopt children from foreign countries.
In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason:
they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life.
Most adopted children know that they are adopted.
Psychologists and childcare experts generally think this is a good idea.
However, many adopted children or adoptees
have very little information about their biological parents.
As a matter of fact,
it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents,
because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed.
The information is secret, so no one can see it.
Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents.
Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not.
The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make.
Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents.
Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents,
they do know that their adoptive parents want them,
love them and will care for them.
Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. According to the speaker, why do some couples adopt children?
17. Why is it difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents?
18. Why do many adoptees find it hard
to make the decision to search for their birth parents?
19. What can we infer from the passage?
Passage Two
Katharine Graham graduated from the University of Chicago in 1938
and got a job as a news reporter in San Francisco.
Katharine's father used to be a successful investment banker.
In 1933 he bought a failing newspaper-The Washington Post.
Then Katharine returned to Washington and got a job,
editing letters in her father's newspaper.
She married Philip Graham
who took over his father-in-law's position shortly after
and became publisher of The Washington Post.
But for many years her husband suffered from mental illness
and he killed himself in 1963.
After her husband's death, Katharine operated the newspaper.
In the 1970s, the newspaper became famous around the world.
And Katharine was also recognized
as an important leader in newspaper publishing.
She was the first woman to head a major American publishing company-
The Washington Post Company.
In a few years, she successfully expanded the company
to include newspaper, magazine, broadcast and cable companies.
She died of head injuries after a fall when she was 84.
More than 3,000 people attended her funeral
including many government and business leaders.
Her friends said she would be remembered as a woman
who had an important influence on events
in the United States and the world.
Katharine once wrote:
"The world without newspapers would not be the same kind of world."
After her death, the employees of The Washington Post wrote:
"The world without Katharine would not be the same at all."
Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
20. What do we learn from the passage about Katharine's father?
21. What does the speaker tell us about Katharine Graham?
22. What does the comment by employees
of The Washington Post suggest?
Passage Three
Obtaining good health insurance is a real necessity
while you are studying overseas.
It protects you from minor and major medical expenses that can wipe out
not only your savings but your dreams of an education abroad.
There are often two different types of health insurance
you can consider buying:
international travel insurance and student insurance
in the country where you will be going.
An international travel insurance policy
is usually purchased in your home country before you go abroad.
It generally covers a wide variety of medical services
and you are often given a list of doctors in the area
where you will travel who may even speak your native language.
The drawback might be that
you may not get your money back immediately.
In other words, you may have to pay all your medical expenses
and then later submit your receipts to the insurance company.
On the other hand, getting student health insurance in the country
where you will study might allow you
to only pay a certain percentage of the medical cost at the time of service
and thus you don't have to have sufficient cash to pay the entire bill at once.
Whatever you decide, obtaining some form of health insurance
is something you should consider before you go overseas.
You shouldn't wait until you are sick with major medical bills to pay off.
Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
23. Why does the speaker advise overseas students to buy health insurance?
24. What is the drawback of students' buying international travel insurance?
25. What does the speaker say about students' getting health insurance
in the country where they will study?
This is the end of listening comprehension.

was arrested on the Ukrainian border with Poland.
Intelligence chief Vasyl Hrytsak said

in VW brand sales in 11 years
as the company continues to cope with its emissions scandal.
Sales of VW brand cars fell 4.8% in 2015
to 5.82 million cars from 6.2 million a year earlier.
Falling demand in China and US added to the losses
as orders fell in December.
VW has promised it will have a fix in the coming weeks
for the millions of US cars with defeated devices
that disguised emission levels in diesel cars.
Sales began declining after the scandal came to light in September.
Deliveries fell 5.3% in October, 2.4% in November
and 7.9% in December compared with those months the previous year.
The underperformance at VW's largest division
by sales and revenue pulled down annual group deliveries
by 2% to 9.93 million cars, the first drop in 13 years, VW said.
However, speaking on Wednesday,
Volkswagen chief executive Herbert Diess said
he was "optimistic" the company would find a solution soon.
Regulators appear been less confident.

Conversation One
W: Gosh! Have you seen this, Richard?
M: Seen what?
W: In the paper. It says,
there is a man going around pretending he's from the electricity board.
He's been calling at people's homes,
saying he's come to check that all their appliances are safe.
Then he gets around them to make him a cup of tea,
and while they are out of the room he steals their money, handbag,
whatever and makes off with it.
M: But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault;
you should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them.
W: It's all very well to say that.
But someone comes to the door,
and says electricity or gas and you automatically think they are OK,
especially if they flash a card to you.
M: Does this man have an ID then?
W: Yes, that's just it.
It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time.
According to the paper the police are warning people
especially pensioners not to admit anyone
unless they have an appointment.
It's a bit sad.
One old lady told them
she'd just been to the post office to draw her pension when he called.
She said he must have followed her home.
He stole the whole lot.
M: But what does he look like?
Surely they must have a description.
W: Oh, yes, they have.
Let's see, in his thirties, tall, bushy dark hair, slight northern accent,
sounds a bit like you actually.

M: Miss Jones, could you tell me more about your first job
with hotel marketing concepts?
W: Yes, certainly.
I was a marketing consultant responsible for marketing 10 UK hotels.
They were all luxury hotels in a leisure sector, all of a very high standard.
M: Which markets were you responsible for?
W: For Europe and Japan.
M: I see from your resume that you speak Japanese.
Have you ever been to Japan?
W: Yes, I have, I spent a month in Japan in 2006.
I met all the key people in the tourist industry,
the big tour operators and the tourist organizations.
As I speak Japanese I had a very big advantage.
M: Yes, of course.
Have you had any contact with Japan in your present job?
W: Yes, I've had a lot.
Cruises have become very popular with the Japanese
both for holidays and for business conferences.
In fact, the market for all types of luxury holidays
for the Japanese has increased a lot recently.
M: Really, I'm interested to hear more about that,
but first tell me, have you ever traveled on a luxury train,
the Orient Express, for example?
W: No, I haven't.
But I've traveled on the Glacier Express to Switzerland
and I traveled across China by train about 8 years ago.

Directions: In this section,
you will hear three passages.
At the end of each passage,
you will hear three or four questions.

will be spoken only once.
After you hear a question,
you must choose the best answer
from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Time
I think a lot about time
and not just because it's the name of the news organization I work for.
Like most working people,
I find time, or the lack of it,
a never-ending frustration and an unwinnable battle.
My every day is a race against the clock that I never ever seem to win.
This is hardly a lonesome complaint.
According to the families and work institutes,
national study of the changing workforce,
55 percent of employees say they don't have enough time for themselves,
63 percent don't have enough time for their spouses or partners,
and 67 percent don't have enough time for their children.
It's also not a new complaint.
I bet our ancestors returned home from hunting wild animals
and gathering nuts and complained about
how little time they had to paint battle scenes on their cave walls.
The difference is that the boss of animal hunting
and the head of nut gathering probably told them
to shut up or no survival for you.
Today's workers are still demanding control over their time.
The difference is today's bosses are listening.
I've been reading a report issued today
called "When Work Works" produced jointly by three organizations.
They set up to find and award the employers
who employ the most creative and most effective ways
to give their workers flexibility.
I found this report worth reading
and suggest every boss should read it for ideas.
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
16. What is the speaker complaining about?
17. What does the speaker say about our ancestors?
18. Why does the speaker suggest all bosses
read the report by the three organizations?
Passage Two
"Loving a child is a circular business.
The more you give, the more you get, the more you want to give,"
Penelope Leachwon said.
What she said proves to be true of my blended family.
I was born in 1931.
As the youngest of six children, I learned to share my parents' love.
Raising six children during the difficult times of the Great Depression
took its toll on my parents' relationship and resulted in their divorce
when I was 18 years old.
Daddy never had very close relationships with his children
and drifted even farther away from us after the divorce.
Several years later,
a wonderful woman came into his life and they were married.
She had two sons, one of them still at home.
Under her influence,
we became a blended family and a good relationship developed
between the two families.
She always treated us as if we were her own children.
It was because of our other mother, Daddy's second wife,
that he became closer to his own children.
They shared over 25 years together before our father passed away.
At the time of his death, the question came up of my mother,
Daddy's first wife, attending his funeral.
I will never forget the unconditional love shown by my step mother.
When I asked her
if she would object to mother attending Daddy's funeral,
without giving it a second thought,
she immediately replied,
"Of course not, honey. She is the mother of my children."
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
19. According to the speaker, what contributed to her parents' divorce?
20. What brought the father closer to his own children?
21. What message does the speaker want to convey in this talk?
Passage Three
In February last year, my wife lost her job.
Just as suddenly, the owner of the greenhouse
where I worked as manager died of a heart attack.
His family announced that they were going to close the business
because no one in the family wanted to run it.
Things looked pretty gloomy.
My wife and I read the want-ads each day.
Then one morning,
as I was hanging a Going Out of Business sign at the greenhouse,
the door opened and in walked a customer.
She was an office manager
whose company had just moved into the new office park
on the edge of town.
She was looking for potted plants
to place in the reception areas in offices.
"I don't know anything about plants," she said,
"I am sure in a few weeks, they'll all be dead."
While I was helping her select her purchases, my mind was racing.
Perhaps as many as a dozen firms
that recently opened offices in the new office park
and there were several hundred more acres with construction under way.
That afternoon, I drove up to the office park.
By 6 o'clock that evening,
I had signed contracts with 7 companies to rent plants from me
and pay me a fee to maintain them.
Within a week, I had worked out an agreement
to lease the greenhouse from the owner's family.
Business is now increasing rapidly.
And one day we hope to be the proud owners of the greenhouse.
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
22. What do we learn about the greenhouse?
23. What was the speaker doing when a customer walked in one morning?
24. What did the speaker think of when serving the office manager?
25. What was the speaker's hope for the future?
This is the end of listening comprehension.
